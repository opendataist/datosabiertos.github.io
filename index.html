    <br/> Iran s defense budget is projected to reach USD 16.7 billion in 2024, marking a 20% increase from the previous year and accounting for 25% of the national budget. This rise in military spending occurs amidst economic struggles, including soaring inflation and declining purchasing power. Iran s defense priorities are influenced by regional dynamics, such as the Israeli war on Gaza and Lebanon, and rivalry with countries like Saudi Arabia. Israel s military budget has grown by 24% in 2023, driven by its campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon. Saudi Arabia remains the largest military spender in West Asia, leveraging its oil wealth. Iran faces challenges in keeping up with expenditure due to economic sanctions and inflation. The US–Iran confrontation and the US military presence in the region also contribute to Iran s military buildup. A significant portion of Iran s defense budget is allocated to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which controls a vast network of businesses and industries. The IRGC s economic activities generate additional unreported revenues, making it difficult to assess the full scale of Iran s military funding. This situation reflects a global trend of rising military expenditures, particularly in regions experiencing escalating conflicts. Countries are diverting significant resources to the military at the expense of social spending, revealing a global prioritization of military security in an increasingly volatile world. The surge in military spending across West Asia, Europe, and East Asia reflects a world heading toward greater instability, driven by the failure of the UN and its institutions to provide peace, diplomacy, and conflict prevention. States are prioritizing military strength but risk an action–reaction spiral in the increasingly volatile geopolitical and security landscape.

    <br/> The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) launched the NextGen Bus Navigation Pilot Program on October 2, 2024, to enhance service for riders by providing turn-by-turn directions to bus drivers. The initiative, a collaboration with Swiftly, a transit technology company, involves equipping 100 buses with tablets that offer visual and audible step-by-step directions, similar to Google Maps.  The program aims to assist bus drivers in navigating detours and other road challenges in real-time. It combines the MBTA s in-house bus dispatching app with a tool developed by Swiftly. The MBTA s General Manager and CEO, Phillip Eng, emphasized the importance of using technology to empower dispatchers and operators to make timely decisions and improve travel reliability for riders.  In addition to the tablets, the pilot program introduces new features in the MBTA s internal app, allowing bus dispatchers to draw and share detours with inspectors and other staff in real-time across the system. The transit agency plans to extend the program to all bus garages and provide real-time bus detour information to riders after evaluating the pilot over the fall and winter.  The MBTA has hired over 350 new operators in the past year, and the pilot program is expected to boost their confidence and enable them to learn more routes and cover trips that would otherwise be dropped. The initiative demonstrates the MBTA s commitment to improving bus service and supporting its workforce in delivering reliable travel for riders.

    <br/> The University of Alaska (UA) is set to revitalize the Alaska Energy Data Gateway, a project aimed at providing equitable access to Alaska s energy data and analytics. This three-year initiative, supported by the Alaska Legislature, involves collaboration between UA Fairbanks  Alaska Center for Energy and Power (ACEP) and UA Anchorage s Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER). The project will enhance the gateway, which contains comprehensive energy and socioeconomic data from across Alaska, enabling communities, researchers, and energy project developers to make informed decisions.  The Alaska Energy Authority s Alaska Energy Security Task Force recommended the data-gathering effort in its 2023 report. The datasets document electrical generation capacity, energy production, fuel costs, and metrics on human, technical, and financial capacity. The gateway was first released in 2013 as part of a collaborative ACEP-ISER research program, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy s Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.  The project aims to develop new techniques for data-sharing, revitalize critical technology, and improve distribution. It will also work with state agency partners to support the accessibility and documentation of Alaska s energy data. Partners in the project include ACEP, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, the Alaska Energy Authority (AEA), the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, the Department of Commerce, and ISER.  Gwen Holdmann, a senior researcher at ACEP and UAF associate vice chancellor for research, innovation, and industry partnerships, expressed excitement about the state of Alaska recognizing the value of this resource and investing in its revitalization.
