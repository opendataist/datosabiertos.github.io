        <h2>&#34;How Open Data is Driving Transparency, Climate Action, and Sustainable Development&#34;</h2>
        <p>Welcome to today&rsquo;s Open Data Digest! Here, we share the latest news and insights about open data. We want to show you how sharing information can make our world better. Let&rsquo;s get started with today&rsquo;s stories.</p>
<p>Veeva Systems is a company that makes cloud software for the life sciences industry. Recently, it has been in the news because of important investments. Some big investors, like Stephens Investment Management Group, have bought more shares of the company. At the same time, some company leaders have sold their shares. Even with these changes, Veeva Systems' stock price went up by 4.3%. This shows that people trust the company&rsquo;s solutions for drug and biotech firms. It also highlights the need for transparency in business, so investors can make smart choices.</p>
<p>The University of Leeds has led a report on global climate change. The report shows that human activities have caused the Earth to warm up. In the last ten years, global temperatures have gone up by 1.19°C. In 2023, the rise reached 1.3°C. To keep the warming below 1.5°C, we can only release 200 gigatons more of carbon. This report will help guide new climate actions at the COP29 conference. It shows how important it is to share environmental data to make good climate policies.</p>
<p>The Lerwick Met Office in the Shetland Isles has been keeping weather records since 1921. They are now digitizing data from 1927 to 1984. This will help us understand climate patterns better. Studies show that weather in Lerwick is linked to sea temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. A citizen science project is helping to transcribe the remaining data. This shows how public involvement can help us learn more about climate change.</p>
<p>Open Access Data Centres (OADC) in Africa are leading the way in sustainability. They focus on energy efficiency, managing waste responsibly, and involving the community. OADC is working hard to reduce its carbon footprint. They also have programs to mentor young girls in STEM fields and are exploring solar power. This shows how data centers can be both environmentally and socially responsible.</p>
<p>The healthcare sector is changing with more use of e-prescribing and value-based payment models. The COVID-19 pandemic has sped up the use of health IT systems. This makes accurate data very important. The Affordable Care Act and the use of condition categories for healthcare payments are areas where open data can help improve patient care and efficiency.</p>
<p>Zaki Barzinji is the Senior Director at Aspen Digital. He supports tech policy, equity, and justice for underrepresented communities. With ten years of experience in politics and public service, Zaki works to amplify minority voices and address the digital divide. His work shows the importance of open data in creating fair digital infrastructure and ensuring all communities benefit from technology.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s stories show how open data can change many areas, from business transparency and climate action to sustainable development and healthcare. By sharing information, we can make positive changes and build a better world for future generations. Let&rsquo;s keep supporting open data and work towards a more informed, fair, and sustainable society.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us in today&rsquo;s Open Data Digest. Stay tuned for more updates and insights on how open data impacts our world.</p>
