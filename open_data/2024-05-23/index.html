Keith Durbin, the Chief Information Officer of Nashville and Davidson County, retired on May 10 after 15 years of service. Durbin did many great things, like creating the region’s information security program, an open data portal, and the hubNashville/311 system. He also started free public Wi-Fi and the Connected Nashville project, which improved the city’s digital systems. John Griffey, the current chief security officer, will be the temporary CIO and will continue Durbin’s work.
Italian company Fabrick is buying 75% of Germany&rsquo;s finAPI GmbH to boost business innovation in Europe. This deal needs approval from regulators. The founders of finAPI will keep the remaining 25%. FinAPI, started in 2008, works in Open Banking, Data Intelligence, KYC, and Payments, serving over 350 clients in various countries. This deal will help Fabrick grow internationally and strengthen its presence in the DACH region.
Cloudera and OCBC won the &ldquo;Best Big Data and Analytics Infrastructure Implementation&rdquo; at the Financial Technology Innovation Awards 2024. They used Cloudera Data Platform and Cloudera Machine Learning to improve OCBC&rsquo;s banking services. This partnership has helped with better personalization, fraud detection, and operational efficiency, showing the power of big data and analytics in banking.
A study using data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study looked at how changes in socioeconomic status (SES) affect dementia risk. Researchers tracked 9,186 people aged 65&#43; from 2010 to 2016. They found that moving up in SES lowered dementia risk, while moving down increased it. The study highlights the importance of SES in brain health and calls for more research on ways to reduce dementia risk.
Greatland Gold plc got a new Exploration License for the Mt Egerton gold-copper project in Western Australia. The 134km² Woodlands area has potential for large gold and copper deposits. With an Indigenous Land Use Agreement in place, Greatland plans to use advanced exploration methods to find and develop major mineral deposits in this under-explored region.
Digital technology is changing agriculture, especially rice farming, with strong prediction and prevention models. The RiceMoRe app, developed by the Department of Crop Production, the Centre for Digital Transformation and Agricultural Statistics, and the International Rice Research Institute, has been helpful since 2018. It helps measure productivity factors, reduce costs, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The Mekong Delta uses this tool to manage one million hectares of high-quality rice, supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to improve sustainability and diversify farmer incomes.
The Commerce Commission&rsquo;s study on banking competition has started debates over the Reserve Bank of New Zealand&rsquo;s (RBNZ) capital rules. RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr said the rules have not hurt banks&#39; profits, pointing to ANZ&rsquo;s stable return on equity. The final report, due by August 20, will address worries about the impact on smaller banks and the dominance of big banks.
AJ Bell now has over 500,000 platform customers, with assets under management rising 13% to £80.3bn. A Moneybox survey shows that people who rely on family for financial advice are £42,000 worse off. This highlights the need for better financial education, as a UK committee urges improved financial literacy in schools.
Stay tuned for more updates as we keep exploring the exciting world of open data and its impact on our lives. Together, we can use the power of information to create a better future for our children and communities.
