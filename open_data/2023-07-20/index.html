Several technology vendors, including Google Cloud, Elastic, and MongoDB, have already joined the program.
In the world of data analysis, Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets are powerful tools for organizing and analyzing data. However, when working on collaborative projects, there is a risk of accidental changes to important cells. To prevent this, users can lock specific cells or elements of a spreadsheet while still allowing customization and control. This ensures that the integrity of the project is maintained.
According to recent open data released by NATO, only 11 out of 30 member countries are expected to meet or exceed the 2% of GDP defense spending target in 2023. This means that 63% of NATO members will fall short of the target. The 2% of GDP defense spending target was agreed upon by NATO states in 2006 to ensure the readiness of the Alliance.

A recent study found that rates of teen suicide and suicide attempts were lowest during the pandemic when schools were shut down. The number of incidents increased between 2016 and 2019 but decreased when schools closed in 2020. However, when classes resumed in 2021, the rate not only rebounded but exceeded expectations. The researchers suggest that interventions during peak months could help protect against seasonal increases in teen suicidality.
Halliburton Company reported a strong financial performance for the second quarter of 2023, driven by increased completion tool sales, higher artificial lift activity, improved cementing activity, and higher stimulation activity.
