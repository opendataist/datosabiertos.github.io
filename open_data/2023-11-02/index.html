  <meta name="description" content="Researchers at the University of Cambridge have created a computer program that can identify homes that waste energy with 90% accuracy. This program uses data like energy performance certificates and satellite images to find areas of a building that lose the most heat and determine if a home is old or new. The researchers believe they can make the program even better in the future. This technology could help policymakers find homes that need to reduce their carbon emissions, which would save time and resources.
The Cambridge researchers have also made a program that can identify houses that are difficult to reduce carbon emissions from with 90% accuracy. These houses are responsible for over a quarter of all housing emissions but are not usually targeted for improvement. The program uses data like energy performance certificates and street view images to classify these houses based on their age, structure, location, and available data. Policymakers can use this program to prioritize efforts to reduce carbon emissions and save time and resources by focusing on the most important houses.
In financial news, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) reported that it made a record $2.0 billion in the third quarter of 2023, which is an 11% increase from the previous year. The company has been focused on being innovative and creating value for its stockholders, and this has paid off. The company earned $0.96 per share and $1.46 per share when adjusted. ICE&rsquo;s acquisition of Black Knight has also helped the company grow and expand its mortgage network. The company is committed to being innovative and creating value for its stockholders.
The Cambridge researchers have also made a program that can identify and prioritize houses that need to be retrofitted and have measures taken to reduce carbon emissions. The program uses street view images, aerial images, and other data to achieve a 90% accuracy rate in classifying these houses. Policymakers can use this program to save time and resources by focusing on the most important houses. The researchers are now working on expanding the program to include more data about energy use, poverty levels, and thermal images of building facades.
The Association for Geographic Information (AGI) has announced the lineup for its main event, GeoCom 23. The event will have speakers from Google, Vodafone, CGI, and Fugro, among others, who will talk about topics like artificial intelligence, earth observation, cloud computing, and how technology affects traditional cartography. This event is a chance for people to network and discuss how geospatial information can help create a sustainable future.
Finally, Lenovo showcased its newest artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and its vision of &ldquo;AI for All&rdquo; at its annual global innovation event, Tech World. The company believes in using a mix of public, private, and personal AI models to make AI available to everyone. Lenovo wants to create a wide range of AI products for consumers and businesses. To help businesses navigate the world of AI, Lenovo has introduced the Lenovo AI Professional Services Practice.
These advancements in open data, information, facts, knowledge, statistics, analytics, transparency, access, sharing, and collaboration show how technology can make the world better for future generations.
