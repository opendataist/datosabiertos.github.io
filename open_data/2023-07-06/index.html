  <meta name="description" content="Since the start of the Missing Middle housing permit process in Arlington County, eight applications have been accepted and seven more are in progress. The proposed homes are mainly located in or near Metro areas such as East Falls Church, Ballston, Virginia Square, Clarendon, and Pentagon City. The permits are primarily for R-5 and R-6 zoning districts, with three in R-5 and five in R-6. The applications include a mix of townhouses, duplexes, six-plexes, and quad-plexes. Off-street parking varies, with some units having one space per unit and others having less than one space per unit. The permits do not authorize construction, and a separate review is required before builders can start.
Open Access Data Centres (OADC), the data centre infrastructure arm of West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), has reaffirmed its commitment to building world-class data centres in Nigeria and across Africa. The company aims to improve data centre infrastructure on the continent and provide unlimited access to organizations, allowing them to focus on their core business while saving on the cost of building and maintaining their own data centres. OADC plans to expand its data centres as demand increases and ensure uninterrupted power supply by using solar energy. WIOCC will continue to offer connectivity services to data centre operators and ISPs, boosting connectivity and open access to data centre infrastructure in Nigeria and Africa.
Impact Observatory has partnered with Planet Labs to use AI-powered analytics to monitor land cover and land use (LULC) using high-resolution satellite data. The partnership aims to provide customers with accurate, near real-time geospatial insights to support security, environmental, and resource mapping. The benefits of this partnership include increased spatial and temporal resolution, allowing for better classification of features and monitoring of changes. Impact Observatory&rsquo;s IO Monitor service, coupled with PlanetScope imagery, enables government leaders to monitor the world in near real-time and provides trustworthy, actionable information about the changing world.
The Dallas Office of Data Analytics and Business Intelligence (DBI) is one of the largest city data offices in the US, with nearly 50 employees working with over 40 agencies. Led by Chief Data Officer Brita Andercheck, the team has completed numerous high-impact projects, trained city employees in data analytics, and saved the city millions of dollars. Andercheck&rsquo;s team has focused on achieving quick wins to establish the office&rsquo;s reputation, while also quantifying the return on investment to justify the creation of a large data office. The office&rsquo;s influence is leveraged by its high-visibility location in City Hall and its training and technical assistance to other departments. Andercheck also emphasizes the power of storytelling to communicate the value of DBI&rsquo;s work. The article highlights the success of the office&rsquo;s equity project, which will inform the city&rsquo;s next bond package. Overall, investing in data infrastructure produces both short- and long-term savings and justifies future increases in data infrastructure.
