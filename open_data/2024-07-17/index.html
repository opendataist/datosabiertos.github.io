  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of our Open Data Digest! Here, we share the latest news about open data, technology, and innovation. Our goal is to keep you informed with important facts and insights that can help make a better future for everyone.
CARTO has launched AI Agents that change how we use spatial data. These AI Agents make it easy for anyone to understand spatial data by using simple, everyday language. With 73% of companies seeing the value in Spatial Data Science, CARTO&rsquo;s AI Agents help people analyze data without needing to code. This means faster insights and better results for businesses like Aramex. More companies are using cloud-based spatial analysis, showing a big shift in how we work with spatial data.
The Pentagon is improving its command-and-control systems through special experiments. Radha Plumb, the Chief Data and AI Officer, is leading efforts to get more companies involved in finding new solutions. The project, called Open DAGIR, tests new tools and builds data systems to make decision-making better and faster.
The NSTF-South32 Awards honor great work in science, engineering, technology, and innovation in South Africa. The 2023/2024 winners were praised for their work in research, innovation, and environmental care. The awards also highlighted the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in South Africa, showing the country&rsquo;s progress in these areas.
Various research projects are looking into important issues in today&rsquo;s world. Studies are examining teenage risk-taking online, how AI affects science, managing COVID-19 data after the pandemic, and dealing with too much information during communication. Other research is exploring how touch affects social interactions, aiming to improve behavior in the digital age. The Veni program supports new researchers in doing innovative and interesting studies.
The Smart Cities Index 2024 ranks cities based on their economy, technology, quality of life, and solutions to societal problems. Top cities like Canberra, Singapore, Lausanne, London, and Abu Dhabi are leading the way with smart solutions for a better future. These cities focus on community, green spaces, safety, connectivity, and sustainability.
QRG Capital Management Inc. has sold 36.1% of its shares in Veeva Systems Inc., which equals 12,048 shares. Despite this, Veeva Systems reported strong earnings, beating estimates. The company provides cloud-based software for the life sciences industry and is expected to grow. Corporate insiders own 10.50% of the stock, showing confidence in the company&rsquo;s future.
Today&rsquo;s news shows the power of open data and innovation in many areas. From changing spatial data science with AI to improving military systems and celebrating scientific success, these developments highlight the role of knowledge and data in creating a better future. As we continue to explore open data, we can look forward to a world where technology and information bring positive change for everyone.
Stay tuned for more updates in our next edition of the Open Data Digest. Together, we can build a brighter future for the next generations.
