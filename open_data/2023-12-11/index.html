  <meta name="description" content="Dell Technologies is improving its storage capabilities to handle more unstructured data, especially in artificial intelligence (AI). The company&rsquo;s AI-Ready Data Platform, with upgrades to infrastructure and system performance, helps speed up the training of large language models. Dell PowerScale storage, a key part of the platform, is optimized for AI work and can provide up to 80% better performance. Dell is also expanding support for its Dell APEX File Storage to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, making it easier to move data between on-premises and cloud environments.
In another partnership, Schlumberger and the Northern Lights Joint Venture are working with Microsoft to create cloud-based workflows for carbon capture and storage (CCS) operations. The goal is to develop scalable and cost-effective digital solutions for the growing CCS industry. Schlumberger will expand its digital CCS workflows on its Delfi platform, while Microsoft will use its Azure platform to support Northern Lights&#39; business. This collaboration will help the CCS industry grow and contribute to global climate goals.
Meanwhile, the Information and eGovernment Authority (iGA) in Bahrain has launched an updated open data portal that meets international standards. The portal has data classification, search tools, interactive viewers, and the ability to track changes in datasets. Currently, the platform has over 387 government databases with more than two million records from 34 government entities. The goal is to promote transparency and electronic participation, and provide decision-makers, investors, researchers, and citizens with up-to-date and comprehensive data. This initiative aligns with the government&rsquo;s economic recovery goals and the Government Plan (2023-2026).
In the financial sector, Brown Capital Management LLC has reduced its ownership in Veeva Systems Inc. by 1.9% in the second quarter. The firm now owns 1,603,364 shares of the technology company&rsquo;s stock, making it the 7th largest holding in their portfolio. Other hedge funds have also made changes to their positions in Veeva Systems. The stock is currently trading at $172.71 and has a market capitalization of $27.75 billion. Analysts predict that the company will have earnings per share of $2.73 for the current year.
These developments show the growing importance of data and knowledge in different sectors. From improving storage for AI to creating digital solutions for carbon capture and storage, organizations recognize the value of data and analytics in driving innovation and tackling global challenges. The launch of the open data portal in Bahrain emphasizes the importance of transparency and access to information for decision-makers and citizens. As the world becomes more connected, collaboration and data sharing will play a crucial role in shaping a better future for future generations.
