  <meta name="description" content="The Rockefeller Foundation has given more than $11 million to help with climate change in poor countries and communities in the United States. The money will support things like making food and health safer, using less coal, getting more solar energy, and promoting better farming. It will also help with the health problems caused by climate change and support native communities.
In other news, Paula Crowell is now the Chief Information Officer (CIO) for Santa Monica. She knows a lot about technology and will lead a team of 50 people. We don&rsquo;t know yet what she will focus on, but she wants to use new ideas and technology to make Santa Monica better.
Lenovo talked about their plans for artificial intelligence (AI) at their event called Tech World. They want to give AI technology to all kinds of organizations. They think that combining different types of AI models will help everyone. They also said they are working with NVIDIA to bring AI to more businesses.
Open Access Data Centres (OADC) is expanding their data centre in Johannesburg, South Africa. They want to provide better data centre infrastructure all over Africa. The Isando site is being improved to hold more equipment. OADC already has four main data centres and over 30 smaller ones in South Africa. They plan to open one in Kinshasa, DRC.
The Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID) is having a conference in Abuja, Nigeria. The conference will bring together journalists, experts, and policymakers to talk about media and democracy in West Africa. The keynote speaker will be Bosun Tijani, Nigeria&rsquo;s Minister of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy. He will talk about how media and civil society can help Nigeria&rsquo;s plan.
These are just a few important things happening in the world of open data today. Stay informed and keep learning about how data, information, and knowledge can make the future better.
