  <meta name="title" content="Romania Deploys F-16 Jets to Secure Airspace, Malaysia Sees Increase in Substance Abuse Cases, and More: Daily Data News Digest"/>
  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, we have some interesting updates on various topics related to data, information, and knowledge. Let&rsquo;s dive right in!
First, we have news from Romania, where the Pentagon has deployed F-16 fighter jets to enhance NATO air policing in the Black Sea region. This move comes after Russian drones and cruise missiles violated the airspace, leading to the closure of airspace along Romania&rsquo;s eastern border. The deployment of these jets aims to secure the airspace and ensure the safety of the region.
Moving on to Malaysia, we have some data from the National Anti-Drugs Agency (AADK) regarding substance abuse cases. The data shows a decrease of over 30% in substance abuse cases between 2015 and 2021. However, recent statistics reveal a 27% increase in substance abuse cases in the first half of 2021, with a significant number involving youths and teenagers. Efforts to combat substance abuse in Malaysia are ongoing, but new challenges have emerged among younger demographics.
Shifting gears, let&rsquo;s talk about Artificial Intelligence (AI). A report on the uses, risks, and adverse effects of AI technologies was reviewed by a committee, emphasizing the need for clear legislation and guidelines to support research and monitor developments in AI. The meeting also discussed the digital transformation of government services, including the launch of Bahrain&rsquo;s open data portal. This portal aims to provide transparent and accessible information to the public.
In the field of healthcare, Clene Inc., a biopharmaceutical company, has announced long-term follow-up data for patients treated with CNM-Au8 in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial. The data shows significantly improved survival rates for ALS patients. This finding provides further evidence of the potential benefits of CNM-Au8 in treating neurodegenerative diseases.
On the topic of electric vehicles (EVs), BYD, a leading EV manufacturer, has reached a significant milestone with the production of its 500,000th BYD Dolphin EV. The Dolphin has made a successful debut in the Malaysian market, with over 200 units registered within a month. This achievement highlights the growing popularity and accessibility of EVs, contributing to a more sustainable future.
In the scientific community, Battelle, the organization responsible for the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), has been awarded a contract to provide over 180 data products to researchers. NEON data has been widely used in scientific papers and publications, contributing to advancements in ecological research. Battelle will continue to work with the scientific community to expand the reach and impact of NEON data and assets.
In the realm of technology, Jammu and Kashmir in India is making strides in digital services. The Chief Secretary praised the IT Department for achieving the top spot in terms of the number of e-services available to citizens. This includes the launch of the JK instance of Open Government Data platform, promoting transparency and accessibility of information.
Lastly, we have news from the education sector. According to the Open Doors Report 2022, India has surpassed China in the number of international students studying in the US. This highlights the growing interest and opportunities for Indian students to pursue higher education abroad. Programs in mathematics and computer sciences have become increasingly popular among Indian students, and more are choosing to stay in the US after completing their degrees.
That concludes today&rsquo;s news digest. We hope these updates provide you with valuable insights into the latest developments in various fields. Stay informed, stay curious, and have a great day!
