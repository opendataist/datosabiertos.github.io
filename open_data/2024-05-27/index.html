  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today’s Daily Open Data Digest! We explore the latest news in open data, information sharing, and digital transparency. Our goal is to keep you updated on how data is changing our world and helping progress in different areas. Here’s what’s happening today:
The cryptocurrency market is very active. Ethereum is doing well, and the SEC has approved ETFs, boosting growth. Important events include Bitcoin options contracts worth $1.4 billion expiring on May 24 and $4.3 billion on May 31. The put/call ratios for Bitcoin and Ethereum are 0.88 and 0.59, giving insights into market feelings. Despite these expirations, no major price changes are expected, showing a balanced market. The total crypto market cap has dropped by 3.6%, highlighting the volatility investors face.
Researchers struggle to access data from tech companies, which is crucial for monitoring hate speech and disinformation on social media, especially during elections in South Africa. While there have been improvements in the EU and US, the global south still faces limited data access. Organizations like UNESCO and the African Alliance for Access to Data are working to improve transparency, but major barriers remain. This shows the ongoing fight for data to ensure human rights and fair elections.
New Zealand is set to change its banking sector with open banking. Starting May 30, major banks will allow customers to let third parties access their banking info for payments, removing the need for card details. This secure API-driven initiative aims to improve financial management, get better deals, and streamline loan applications. Payment services will be available soon, and data-sharing services will roll out later, with Kiwibank joining by 2026. This is a big step towards more financial transparency and consumer empowerment.
Forrester’s latest report on cybersecurity risk ratings shows big improvements in data validation and automation, reducing false positives and improving asset discovery. Top vendors like Bitsight and SecurityScorecard use AI to enhance risk assessment and remediation features. These advancements are expanding to include third-party risk management. The report suggests that risk ratings might merge with broader risk management frameworks, possibly replacing standalone tools. Strong performers include Black Kite and RiskRecon, with UpGuard and Prevalent also making progress.
Despite government incentives, Malaysia&rsquo;s electric vehicle (EV) sales have stalled due to high prices. Data from January 2020 to April 2024 shows BYD, Tesla, and BMW leading EV registrations, with the Tesla Model Y and BYD Atto 3 being the most popular in 2024. EVs currently make up only 1.2% of total vehicle registrations, though there is growth, with 2.28% in early 2024. Malaysia aims for EVs to make up 15% of the total industry volume by 2030. Key challenges include the road tax structure, EV infrastructure, and access to affordable EVs.
Around the world, researchers are pushing for better access to data held by digital operators, seeing it as essential for transparency and human rights. While some progress has been made in the EU and US, regions like South Africa face significant challenges. Limited access to social media data hampers efforts to monitor disinformation and hate speech during elections. Despite initiatives and legal efforts, tech companies often resist sharing data, citing jurisdictional issues. UNESCO and African coalitions continue to push for better data access, but significant barriers remain.
Today&rsquo;s news highlights the critical role of data in driving transparency, innovation, and progress across various sectors. From the dynamic crypto market to the challenges of data access for social media monitoring, and the promising advancements in open banking and cybersecurity, data remains at the forefront of shaping a better future. Stay tuned for more updates and insights in our next edition.
Stay informed, stay empowered.
