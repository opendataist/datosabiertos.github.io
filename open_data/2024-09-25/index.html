  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Open Data Digest! We will look at how open data is changing our world. From improving public transport to fighting false information and making markets clearer, here are the key stories you should know.
Bengaluru is about to change its public transport, thanks to real-time data shared between BMTC and BMRCL with start-ups. The &ldquo;Enroute: A mobility-as-a-service challenge&rdquo; shows how this data can make travel smoother. Start-ups like Namma Yatri and Tummoc use this data for live-tracking and better journey planning. There are still challenges, like adding auto-rickshaws and making rides reliable. But the goal is a fully connected, digital transport network that is reliable and convenient for everyone.
Canada&rsquo;s foreign ministry is having trouble fighting false information online. This is because they have less access to social media data and enemies are using new tricks. A memo from former deputy minister Marta Morgan says the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism can&rsquo;t use social media data from Facebook and Twitter anymore. This makes it hard to protect elections and keep Canada&rsquo;s good name in fighting false information. The ministry is now looking for new partners and more ways to work with social media platforms to solve these problems.
In finance, open data is very important. Ovoca Bio PLC&rsquo;s stock more than doubled after they reported a smaller pretax loss of EUR1.2 million for the first half of 2024, down from EUR2.4 million last year. They also cut administrative expenses by 69%. Electric Guitar PLC&rsquo;s stock rose 23% after they announced a new loyalty app using open banking data. But Directa Plus PLC&rsquo;s stock fell by 31% as their pretax loss grew to GBP2.5 million and revenue dropped to EUR3.4 million. Their full-year revenue is expected to be much lower than the market expected.
The MTA has a new data tool that shows detailed bus speed information by route segments. This helps the public see where buses are slow. Before, only full-route speeds were available. This detailed data lets advocates, reporters, and the public find specific problem areas and times. The tool shows severe congestion in Manhattan, made worse by the pause on congestion pricing. The MTA wants the public to use this data through an &ldquo;open challenge&rdquo; to create projects that improve transit insights. Submissions are due by October 25. The winning project will get a vintage item from the NYC Transit Museum.
Carbon Pulse&rsquo;s CP Daily newsletter gives important news about the global carbon market. Recent highlights include new hires and promotions at Carbon Pulse, calls for carbon credits to offset Scope 3 emissions, and big deals in carbon credits and nature-based solutions. Key topics during Climate Week NYC include methane emissions transparency, carbon removal strategies, and the changing EU ETS. Reports and partnerships focus on reducing greenhouse gases, funding biodiversity, and the voluntary carbon market. Upcoming events and webinars are also featured.
As we deal with our modern world, open data is a powerful tool for driving innovation, transparency, and accountability. Whether it&rsquo;s improving public transport, fighting false information, or making markets clearer, the stories we shared today show the power of open data. Stay tuned for more updates on how open data continues to shape our future.
