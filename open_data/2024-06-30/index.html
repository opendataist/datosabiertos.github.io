  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Open Data Digest. We bring you the latest news, facts, and insights about open data. Today, we talk about new scientific research tools and China’s economic recovery and tech investments.
NASA and IBM have created INDUS, a set of large language models for science. These models are great at tasks like answering questions and recognizing entities. They work better than general models. INDUS helps researchers by providing specialized knowledge and making research faster. This tool is expected to change how we do scientific research.
Researchers around the world can use and adapt INDUS for different scientific tasks. It is a valuable resource. This project helps NASA&rsquo;s other projects like the Open Science Data Repository and the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES-DISC). When used in NASA&rsquo;s Science Discovery Engine, INDUS makes searches more accurate and relevant. This helps advance scientific research.
Now, let&rsquo;s talk about the economy. The Chinese economy is showing signs of recovery. It is expected to grow by 5% by the end of 2024. Big investments in cloud computing are helping this recovery, with Alibaba leading the way. Alibaba is building new data centers in many countries. They are focusing on AI to improve customer experience and offer special cloud services at good prices.
The article also talks about the 30 richest people in China. Famous names like Jack Ma and William Ding are among the top earners. According to Forbes, Zhong Shanshan is the richest person in China. He has a net worth of $59.8 billion from his businesses, Nongfu Spring and Wantai Biological.
Today&rsquo;s news shows how important open data is for scientific innovation and economic growth. The partnership between NASA and IBM shows how specialized knowledge and data can improve research. China’s investments in cloud computing and AI show how tech advancements can help the economy recover.
People should know about these projects because they show the power of open data. Understanding these ideas can help people make better decisions and support policies that promote transparency and innovation.
Public opinion is very important for the success of open data projects. When people see the benefits, they are more likely to support these practices. For example, the positive response to NASA&rsquo;s open data projects has led to more collaboration and funding. This helps advance scientific research.
Another example is the public&rsquo;s trust in Alibaba&rsquo;s tech investments. This trust has helped economic growth and innovation in China. These case studies show how public opinion can affect the success and impact of open data projects.
Thank you for joining us. Until next time, keep exploring the world of open data!
