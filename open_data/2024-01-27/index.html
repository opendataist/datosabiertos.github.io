  <meta name="description" content="Portland recently conducted a Stolen Vehicle Operation (SVO) to show how open data can help solve community problems. By working with other agencies and updating their pursuit policy, law enforcement was able to recover 11 stolen vehicles in 25 stops.
Open data allows different agencies to share information, facts, and statistics. This helps them work together better by finding patterns, identifying problem areas, and developing strategies to fight crimes like car theft.
The updated pursuit policy, based on evidence and collaboration, played a big role in the operation&rsquo;s success. It made sure officers and the public were safe while chasing suspects.
This operation is part of ongoing efforts to deal with stolen cars and related crimes in Portland. Law enforcement wants to make the community safer by using open data and new strategies.
Open data isn&rsquo;t just for law enforcement. It also helps in healthcare. The Patient Safety Movement Foundation (PSMF) recently talked about making healthcare safer and preventing harm. They discussed the importance of sharing data, reducing healthcare differences, and including patients and families in decisions.
The PSMF is committed to stopping medical errors by using evidence and working together. This shows how open data can bring positive change. By sharing knowledge, healthcare providers can find ways to improve and save lives.
Companies like Veeva Systems Inc. use open data to improve their business. This cloud-based software company for the medical industry has seen investors become more interested in them. This shows that investors believe Veeva Systems can use data and analytics to grow and be innovative.
Open data is valuable in many areas. It helps organizations make good choices, be transparent, and work together. As more people see the benefits of open data, we can expect more progress in solving problems and making a better future.
In conclusion, the recent Stolen Vehicle Operation in Portland, along with other examples, shows how open data can solve community problems, improve healthcare, and help businesses grow. By being open, accessible, and working together, we can make the most of open data and create a safer, smarter, and better society.
