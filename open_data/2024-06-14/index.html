  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Daily Open Data Digest! Here, we explore the latest news in open data. From fusion energy to AI in politics, today&rsquo;s stories show how data can change our world for the better.
Artificial intelligence (AI) might soon be smarter than humans. This has led to debates about AI&rsquo;s role in government. In 2024, AI chatbots like VIC in Wyoming and Steve AI in the UK are running for office. These AI candidates support transparency and new ideas, though they might not win. This raises questions about how AI and humans will share leadership roles in the future. While some worry about AI control, many are unhappy with current leaders. So, exploring AI governance, even if controversial, might be worth it.
The National Institute for Fusion Science&rsquo;s Large Helical Device (LHD) has set a record by generating 0.92 terabytes of data per experiment. This aligns with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) and is now available on Amazon Web Services&#39; &ldquo;Plasma and Fusion Cloud.&rdquo; By using Open Science principles and assigning Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to the data, this project encourages global teamwork and new ideas in fusion energy research. Moving 2 petabytes of data to a public platform is a big step toward finding sustainable energy solutions.
Digital Earth Africa has started the Waterbodies Monitoring Service. This service gives detailed information on over 700,000 water bodies in Africa using satellite data. Updated weekly, it tracks changes in surface water over time and offers country-specific statistics and API access for customization. Developed with user input, it stands out for its detailed and current data. This helps decision-makers monitor and manage water resources better. Dr. Lisa-Maria Rebelo says the service addresses user needs and improves data sharing, making it a valuable tool for managing water in Africa.
Sharad Kumar talks about the importance of good data for AI. Organizations need high-quality, diverse data for effective AI. Integrating unified data formats and governance helps overcome data fragmentation and old systems. By combining data into a single storage platform, organizations can create a trusted data foundation. This improves compatibility and flexibility. This mix of data management and generative AI is key for advancing AI applications and unlocking their full potential.
Natalie Wolfsen, CEO of Orion Advisor Solutions, focuses on combining wealth and technology on one platform while bringing employees back to offices on a hybrid basis. She emphasizes open architecture, data security, and the importance of in-person collaboration. Wolfsen aims to improve behavioral finance tools, personalization, and AI technologies for better client service. Orion is testing AI tools for knowledge management and efficiency, positioning itself for growth and innovation in the financial advisory industry.
Today&rsquo;s news shows the power of open data in many fields. From AI governance to fusion energy research and water management, data integration and sharing lead to a more transparent, innovative, and sustainable future. As we keep using data, we move closer to creating a better world for our children and future generations.
