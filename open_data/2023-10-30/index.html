  <meta name="description" content="Advantage Solutions Inc., a provider of sales and marketing services, has made a significant move in the open-data retail industry. They have sold their Atlas Technology Group&rsquo;s business to Crisp, an open-data retail platform. This acquisition will allow Crisp to solidify its market leadership and provide consumer goods brands with enhanced retail sales data to optimize inventory and marketing. Crisp will migrate Atlas&#39; existing customers to its cloud-based data-sharing platform and collaborate with Advantage to offer supply chain analytics and an expanded retail footprint.
Lenovo, a leading technology company, has also made a big announcement. They have unveiled their &ldquo;AI for All&rdquo; strategy, committing to investing $1 billion in AI innovation. Lenovo will adopt a hybrid approach to AI, combining public, private, and personal foundation models. Their AI capabilities will prioritize data security and user privacy, operating exclusively within devices or securely with on-premises servers. Lenovo aims to bring powerful and tailored AI to customers worldwide through its next-generation AI-ready infrastructure.
Meanwhile, experts at an international conference in Dhaka, Bangladesh, have highlighted the potential of digital public infrastructure (DPI) and artificial intelligence (AI) to eliminate the digital divide in the country. The conference, titled &ldquo;DPI and AI for #ZeroDigitalDivide,&rdquo; focused on the feasibility of creating an inclusive and digitally empowered world through the optimal use of DPI and AI. Bangladesh has already made progress in delivering digital services to marginalized communities, but there is still work to be done in bridging the gender-based digital divide and ensuring sustainable development by 2041.
Advances in AI present challenges to democratic principles such as privacy, transparency, accountable governance, and non-discrimination. Civil society organizations (CSOs) have a crucial role to play in addressing these challenges and promoting democratic approaches to governing AI. A recent report highlights the need for CSOs to engage with AI governance, bringing in technical expertise, cross-sectoral collaboration, and strategic communication. The report emphasizes the importance of democratic principles in shaping AI&rsquo;s trajectory.
These developments in open data, AI, and digital infrastructure are shaping the future of our world. They offer opportunities for enhanced retail sales data, tailored AI solutions, and bridging the digital divide. As we move forward, it is essential to prioritize transparency, access, and collaboration to ensure that these advancements benefit all and leave a better world for future generations.
