    <p>The number of Russian soldiers killed in the last four weeks of the war in Ukraine has gone up by more than 60,000, a Russian media outlet says, with the highest number since February 2022, the BBC has confirmed. Why is this really linked to Russia s advance in east Asia and the conflict in eastern Europe? Should this be necessary. But Про Russia could increase their numbers, and why is it not related to military recruitment drives, it has been claimed by the Russian government, but it is believed that the number is  inaccurate  - and is not incorrect, as reports say hundreds of people have died during the War in Russia? The BBC looks at the new figures for the first time in nearly five years. The latest figure is still being published by BBC Russian service analysts and journalists. But what does it mean for those who were known to be the most significant deaths since the end of this year, writes Russian journalist Dmitry Treshchanov, who spoke to BBC News Russia, saying there is no evidence that thousands are now among the dead army officers who have been shot dead in war against Ukraine, or because they have not been in public until the start of next year? BBC Russia is investigating what it calls the  backlog  of death statistics. Here is the full list of suspected Russian conscripts who are reported to have told the media that there are more relatives to the country?</p>
