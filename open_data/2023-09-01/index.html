  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, we have some exciting updates and announcements related to data, information, and knowledge. These developments aim to enhance accessibility, transparency, and the transfer of valuable insights.
First, let&rsquo;s talk about Oasis, a non-profit organization in the insurance industry. They have created an open-source platform that allows for the creation and use of catastrophe models. These models, which follow the OED format, are designed to make insurance exposure data more accessible and easier to model and transfer. This is great news for the insurance industry as it will help improve risk assessment and management.
Moving on to the financial industry, there have been some interesting press releases this week. ADP reports that private sector employment has increased by 177,000 jobs in August. This is a positive sign for the economy and shows that businesses are growing and creating more job opportunities. In addition, the 2023 Debt.com Budgeting Survey reveals that 85% of respondents are budgeting. This is a great step towards financial literacy and responsible money management.
In the tech world, Google Cloud has announced several updates and enhancements related to AI. One of the highlights is the release of Cloud TPU 5ve, a cost-efficient and scalable AI chip for training and inference of large AI models. This will enable developers to build and deploy more powerful AI applications. Google has also introduced Multislice technology, which allows for the scaling of workloads using multiple TPU chips. This will help improve the performance and efficiency of AI workloads.
Another exciting update from Google Cloud is the availability of A3 virtual machine instances powered by Nvidia GPUs. These instances offer faster training and greater networking bandwidth, making it easier for developers to build and deploy AI applications. Additionally, Google has made optimizations for Google Distributed Cloud and launched an enterprise version of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). These updates will help businesses leverage the power of AI and cloud computing to drive innovation and growth.
In the financial industry, there have been several notable announcements. BMO has launched a mobile wallet for virtual cards, making it easier for customers to make secure and convenient payments. TurboTenant is leveraging AI to write rental property listings, saving time and effort for landlords. KeyBank has also surpassed $1 million funded in home buyer credits, helping more people achieve their dream of homeownership.
Overall, these updates and announcements highlight the importance of data, information, and knowledge in driving innovation and growth across various industries. They also emphasize the need for transparency and accessibility in order to make the most of these valuable resources. As we continue to embrace the digital age, it is crucial that we leverage open data and use it to create a better world for future generations.
