  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today’s edition of the Daily Open Data Digest. Here, we explore the latest discoveries and advancements in open data. Today&rsquo;s stories show how information, facts, and statistics can change our world, from uncovering ancient secrets to improving modern technology.
Satellite images have found hidden structures under the Mahabodhi Temple Complex in Bodh Gaya, Bihar. This site is sacred to Buddhism. Researchers discovered a buried monastery with a moat and settlement. M. B. Rajani leads this study, which looks at the site&rsquo;s treasures from the 5th or 6th century CE. The research also examines the travels of the 7th-century monk Xuanzang, who greatly influenced Buddhism in China. These findings show how important data is in uncovering history and preserving culture.
A survey by Cloudera shows that 90% of IT leaders are using AI, but many face problems due to old infrastructure and a lack of skilled workers. Issues like security risks, training gaps, and high costs remain. Despite these challenges, AI is improving customer experiences, operational efficiency, and analytics. Trust in data is key for successful AI use. Cloudera’s hybrid open data lakehouse helps companies use their data for better analysis and decision-making, reflecting the views of IT leaders from large companies and key AI uses.
The Pentagon is preparing for a big test of its joint command and control concept, JADC2, with multiple nations to improve information sharing. The exercise, planned for 2025, aims to enhance communication strategies and policies by focusing on mission success over data protection. Programs like GIDE and JADC2 are breaking down data barriers within the Pentagon, helping cooperation with commercial companies. This effort shows the important role of data in national security and international cooperation.
The enhanced Public Procurement Information Platform (PPIP) was launched by PPRA, GIZ, and @iLabAfrica Strathmore University to improve transparency and efficiency in public procurement in Kenya. Key features include advanced tender viewing options, increased contract award visibility, and automated account approvals for procuring entities. With about 900 procuring entities in Kenya, the goal is to expand to over 34,000 entities, increasing reach and impact. This launch marks a big step in improving public procurement processes for efficiency and accountability.
The trend of cloud-based deployments is growing, with a 200% increase in applications and services compared to 2021. Companies are doing well in digital channels, with high user ratings and a record number of users using their apps. Virtual assistants on platforms like WhatsApp are seeing significant growth and customer satisfaction. In Open Finance, companies are achieving impressive volumes through credit portability. Using technology to improve customer experience and drive growth in various digital solutions is becoming more important.
Cloudera has announced updates to improve open interoperability, data security, and governance. These updates include Iceberg REST Catalog integration for easy access to Apache Iceberg tables and a preview of Shared Data Experience (SDX) for unified data security and metadata management. These updates aim to improve performance, scalability, and resiliency while reducing costs. Cloudera stresses the importance of unified data access and governance across various data assets and locations. These updates will be shown at the EVOLVE24 event in Singapore.
Today’s stories show the big impact of open data on our world, from uncovering historical treasures to advancing modern technology and improving public services. As we keep using the power of data, we move closer to a more informed, efficient, and transparent future. Stay tuned for more updates in our next edition of the Daily Open Data Digest.
