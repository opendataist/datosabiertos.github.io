  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, we have some interesting updates on the world of open data and its impact on various sectors. Let&rsquo;s dive right in.
First up, we have Microsoft, one of the leading tech giants, experiencing a major data leak. An employee accidentally disclosed an &ldquo;overly permissive&rdquo; shared access signature (SAS) token, which granted excessive privileges to sensitive data. This incident serves as a reminder of the risks associated with oversharing data and potential supply chain attacks. Microsoft and security specialists are working together to inform customers and prevent similar incidents in the future.
Moving on, Thailand is looking to address structural challenges and increase productivity and competitiveness. The country aims to be more open and transparent by adopting open technologies and selecting trusted technology partners. Embracing artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI can help transform the country, but data quality, governance, fairness, and responsibility are crucial. Thailand also aims to be nimble, open, agile, and adaptable to attract investment in green and digital technologies.
In the realm of telecom industry API interoperability, the Linux Foundation&rsquo;s CAMARA project has made significant progress. With over 250 participating organizations and 750 contributors, the project has now graduated to a funded model. This development will introduce a Governing Board, Technical Steering Committee, and End User Council to manage collaboration at scale. Interested parties are invited to join as sponsors, associating organizations, participating organizations, or individuals.
The International ESG Association (IESGA) recently hosted a forum focused on achieving a sustainable society. The forum aimed to link Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Interdisciplinary research and influencing high-level policy development were highlighted as crucial in achieving the UN SDGs by 2030. The forum provided a platform for new ideas and collaboration to achieve societal impact.
In another incident involving Microsoft, the company&rsquo;s AI research team accidentally exposed a large cache of private data on GitHub. The data leak occurred while publishing open-source training data and included personal computer backups, passwords, and internal Teams messages. Microsoft swiftly removed the exposed data, assuring that no customer data or other internal services were compromised. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of proper data security measures.
Lastly, we have news about former White House physician Anthony Fauci and his wife, Dr. Christine Grady. Their net worth has increased significantly in recent years, with Fauci being the highest-paid public official in the United States. Despite criticism for his handling of the pandemic, Fauci remains a prominent figure in the medical community.
These news updates highlight the importance of data, information, and transparency in today&rsquo;s world. From data leaks to open-source projects, it is crucial to handle and share information responsibly. As we navigate the challenges of the modern age, it is essential to stay informed and be aware of the impact our actions have on society.
Remember, knowledge is power, and staying informed about open data and related topics can help us make better decisions for ourselves, our families, and our communities. Stay curious and keep seeking knowledge, as it is the key to a brighter future.
