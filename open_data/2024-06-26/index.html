Open data is changing our world. It helps us innovate and stay transparent. From building better AI to improving healthcare, open data is key to making big changes. Here’s a look at the latest news in open data.
Ethical AI and Transparent Governance
In the UK, as the General Election nears, there&rsquo;s a push for ethical AI. People want AI that is fair and clear. They also want it to help the environment and democracy. Good AI should be safe and respect human rights. Countries need to work together to make sure AI is used responsibly.
Sustainable Architecture and ESG Compliance
In building design, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) is very important. New methods are making buildings that meet ESG goals. This includes choosing good sites and improving energy use. These buildings are better for people and the planet. They also help companies make smart choices.
Community Development Through Data
In Sharjah, the &lsquo;Regional Data &amp; Community Development Forum&rsquo; shows how data can improve society. Under Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, the event highlights how data helps in healthcare, education, and city planning. Using data, leaders can make services better and help communities grow.
Transparency in City Governance
In Vancouver, Mayor Ken Sim asked for $80,000 more for his office budget to hire a scheduler. This led to a debate about city spending. The mayor says the money will help his office run smoothly. This shows why managing budgets well and being open about spending is important.
Promoting the Welsh Language Through AI
The Welsh Government is working with OpenAI to improve AI in the Welsh language. They want to make AI tools that use Welsh better. This helps more people use and learn Welsh, supporting education and the economy.
Tech Innovation and Economic Growth
In Buffalo, Nicholas Barone and Jonathan Gorczyca, founders of Helm Experience &amp; Design, are celebrating their company&rsquo;s 10th anniversary. Helm has helped the local economy by creating digital products and software. Their work brings jobs and growth to the area, showing how tech can boost communities.
Advancements in Data Management
Onehouse, a data company, got $35 million to improve its cloud data platform. Their tools, LakeView and Table Optimizer, make data easier to manage and cheaper to store. This helps companies get real-time insights and use machine learning.
AI in Healthcare
InterSystems is using AI to change healthcare. They have tools like an assistant for doctors, an AI helper for patient records, and a personal dashboard. These tools aim to make patient care better. At the InterSystems Global Summit 2024, more will be discussed about how AI is improving healthcare and other fields.
Open data helps us make positive changes by being transparent and innovative. Knowing about these efforts helps people and communities get involved in making a better world. Public support is important for open data projects. For example, the UK’s focus on ethical AI has gained public trust. Similarly, using AI to promote the Welsh language has made people more accepting of it.
By learning about open data, people can make smart choices and help create a more open and innovative society. Stay tuned for more updates on how open data is changing our lives and communities.
