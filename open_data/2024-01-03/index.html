  <meta name="description" content="Study Finds Lack of Transparency in Ocean Activity
A recent study in the journal Nature has revealed concerning information about industrial activity in the world&rsquo;s oceans and the lack of transparency around it. Global Fishing Watch led the study, using machine learning and satellite imagery to make the first global map of large vessel traffic and offshore infrastructure.
The study discovered that 75% of the world&rsquo;s industrial fishing vessels are not publicly tracked. This means that a lot of fishing activity, particularly in Africa and south Asia, is happening without the public knowing. This lack of transparency raises worries about illegal fishing and industrial vessels going into protected areas.
The study also showed that offshore energy development is growing fast. By 2021, there will be more wind turbines than oil platforms. However, over 25% of transport and energy vessel activity is not included in public tracking systems. This shows the need for more transparency in ocean management.
These findings are important for the environment and public health. The Movimiento Ambientalista Colombiano, an environmental movement in Colombia, said it&rsquo;s important to address deforestation, especially in the Amazon, by changing to a silvopasture system. They also called for the environment and health ministries to work together to deal with the health problems caused by environmental damage.
Transparency and protection for environmental leaders are also important. The spokesperson asked the Colombian government to sign the Escazú Agreement, which supports transparency and protection for environmental leaders. The government hasn&rsquo;t agreed to it yet, but the spokesperson encouraged peaceful protests and sharing information to put pressure on them.
In general, this study shows how important it is to have open data and transparency when dealing with environmental and social challenges. Governments, organizations, and individuals need accurate and full information to make good decisions and take action. By promoting transparency and making data available to the public, we can work towards a better future for our planet and the next generations.
