  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s world, data is very important. It helps in many areas like government transparency and financial technology. This shows why we need to keep investing in accurate and easy-to-access information.
Dr. Oliver Chinganya is a well-known statistician. He says government statisticians should be independent and fair. At the launch of AmariStat, a new project for sharing data in English-speaking African countries, Dr. Chinganya talked about the need for clear and correct data for decision-makers. Even though there are challenges, he believes it&rsquo;s important to invest in skilled people and modern technology to improve data systems. AmariStat&rsquo;s start is a big step towards working with schools and building better data systems, which will help with making good policy decisions in the region.
Emily Moyer used public records to help her fiancé&rsquo;s legal case. This shows how important government transparency is. But delays in getting these records, which happen in Spokane and other places, make it hard. More people are asking for records, overwhelming the agencies. Fees and other obstacles make it tough for citizens to get records quickly. Companies like LexisNexis add to the delay, affecting public interest. We need reforms to improve access to records, especially in places like Washington and Idaho.
In the UK, a fintech company called Triver raised £2.5 million to help small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) get quick funding. Using AI and Open Banking, Triver helps over 250 SMEs by providing fast underwriting and funding. CEO Jerome Le Luel says technology helps SMEs succeed, with plans to grow and innovate more. This shows how financial technology can support SME growth and economic stability.
Sharing open data, like Medicare pricing and consumer complaints, helps consumers by showing price differences and improving services. Open data movements aim to make government data available to everyone, giving consumers power against unclear institutions like banks and hospitals. Transparent data has led to faster responses and more resolutions for consumers. This trend shows the importance of supporting open data for a fair marketplace.
A report by Our City Action Buffalo shows that developers, wealthy homeowners, and corporations are not paying enough property taxes. The report shows a drop in taxes paid by these groups, who get tax breaks and exemptions. With a financial crisis and a possible $58 million shortfall next year, there is a push to tax the rich to solve the city&rsquo;s money problems. Mayor Byron W. Brown called the report an opinion piece, showing how controversial this issue is.
A survey on affordability checks in the UK gambling industry found that only 14% of people would share information with gambling companies because of privacy concerns. While some support help for at-risk players, most think businesses shouldn&rsquo;t check gambling affordability. The Gambling Commission was criticized for not sharing data and using questionable statistics. Despite industry concerns, the Commission wants to prevent harm while allowing adults to gamble responsibly, with plans for a pilot program using open source data.
The UN General Assembly passed a resolution to improve international cooperation for AI capacity-building. This aims to close the digital gap between developed and developing countries. The resolution calls for fair participation and representation for all member states, with coordination through various partnerships. By promoting good AI practices, protecting human rights, and fostering innovation, the UN aims to address digital inequalities and support sustainable development.
Today&rsquo;s news shows how open data can bring transparency, support economic growth, and address social inequalities. As we keep investing in accurate and accessible information, we move towards a more informed and fair world. Knowing about these open data developments gives us hope and a way forward for a better future.
