  <meta name="description" content="Today&rsquo;s Open Data Digest: Innovations and Insights Shaping Our Future
Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of our Open Data Digest. We bring you the latest news and discussions in the world of open data. From rebuilding ancient cities to modern AI conferences, and from tree equity to digital changes in the oil and gas industry, let&rsquo;s explore the stories shaping our future.
Yale professor Holly Rushmeier and her team use artificial intelligence to bring the ancient city of Dura-Europos back to life. They take key details from old photos to create detailed 3D models of the city. This project collects artifact data into a linked open data system, making it easy for future research. Rushmeier&rsquo;s lab also uses AI to check damage from Algerian forest fires using satellite data, comparing machine learning methods to improve land recovery. This work not only saves history but also helps in better resource management and planning for affected areas.
Cloudera will host the EVOLVE24 data and AI conference in Dubai. This event will be important for industry leaders, customers, and partners. Sponsored by big tech companies like IBM, AWS, and Red Hat, the conference will have breakout sessions, keynote speeches, and workshops. These will focus on modern data architecture, hybrid cloud benefits, and speeding up enterprise AI. With Cloudera managing over 25 exabytes of data, this event will talk about the challenges of AI adoption and data management. Cloudera executives and industry experts will share valuable insights.
On June 18, 2020, a webinar will discuss the OSDU™ data platform. This is a joint effort by nearly 150 industry members to advance digital change in the subsurface and wells space. Titled &ldquo;OSDU data platform: Why we built it,&rdquo; the session will explain the platform&rsquo;s purpose, target audience, functionality, and supported technologies. Featuring Johan Krebbers from Shell and Stephen Whitley from Schlumberger, the webinar will show how the OSDU data platform is set to drive big changes in the oil and gas industry, promoting efficiency and innovation.
Janet McKay, executive director of LEAF, supports tree equity in Toronto. She highlights the big differences in tree distribution across neighborhoods with different income levels and racial backgrounds. The Tree Equity Score Analyzer (TESA), developed by LEAF, the City of Toronto, and American Forests, measures tree canopy and socioeconomic data to show these inequalities. Lower-income and more racialized areas have fewer trees, which affects public health and well-being. McKay points to past discriminatory practices and urban planning as causes of this issue. She stresses the need for strategic efforts to ensure fair access to the benefits of urban forests, especially with climate change.
Today&rsquo;s stories show the power of open data in various fields, from historical preservation and environmental management to industry innovation and social equity. As we continue to use data and analytics, we create a more informed, fair, and sustainable future. Stay tuned for more updates and insights in our next edition of the Open Data Digest.
