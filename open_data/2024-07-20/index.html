  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s fast-changing world, open data is very important. It helps improve local areas and supports sustainable growth. Open data makes things clear, gives people access to information, and lets the public get involved. Let&rsquo;s look at two recent examples that show how powerful open data can be.
In Malawi, geospatial mapping is helping the country grow in a sustainable way. The Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences (MUBAS) has trained the first group of geospatial experts in the country. This will change how Malawi maps its roads, towns, and other important places. By having local experts, Malawi can save money that was spent on hiring foreign experts or sending students abroad for training.
The Vice Chancellor of MUBAS highlighted the important role of geospatial mapping in reaching sustainable development goals. Being able to track disasters and disease outbreaks digitally is a big advantage for the nation. Young people working in this new industry will help support Malawi&rsquo;s development plans.
The recent State of the Map conference showed how important it is to build a community around geospatial mapping. By sharing tools and knowledge, the conference aimed to create a culture of openness and teamwork, making sure everyone can benefit from geospatial data.
In Staten Island, people use open data to make their community better. With nearly 10,000 complaints filed each month to New York City&rsquo;s different departments, residents are actively involved in pointing out issues that need fixing.
The New York Police Department (NYPD) gets the most complaints, mainly about illegal parking and noise. The Department of Sanitation follows, with concerns about dirty conditions and missed garbage collections. The Department of Transportation gets many complaints about street conditions, while the Parks Department deals with problems related to damaged and overgrown trees.
Additionally, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development handles complaints about heat and hot water, and the Department of Environmental Protection gets feedback about the water system and noise.
This increase in public involvement shows how important open data is for transparency and accountability. By making information easy to get and encouraging public feedback, these efforts let residents play an active role in improving their communities.
Both Malawi&rsquo;s geospatial mapping project and Staten Island&rsquo;s complaint system show the power of open data. By promoting transparency, access, and public involvement, these efforts help create more informed and engaged communities. As we keep supporting openness and clarity, we move closer to making a better world for future generations.
Stay tuned for more updates on how open data is making a difference in communities around the world. Together, we can use the power of information to drive positive change.
