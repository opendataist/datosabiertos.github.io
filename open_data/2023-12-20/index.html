  <meta name="description" content="Open data is becoming more popular as organizations, governments, and businesses use data and AI to solve global problems and make a positive impact on society. Open data means making data available to the public for free, which promotes transparency, collaboration, and innovation. This includes using AI and data analytics to address important issues like climate change, human rights abuses, and health inequality.
For instance, the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation recently invested $66.4 million in 148 organizations that are using AI and data analytics to tackle these challenges. The money will support the development of AI products, platforms, and policies that can create positive social change. This initiative aims to make sure that the public&rsquo;s needs are not forgotten as technology advances.
Google is also using AI to solve various problems in Africa, such as food security, flood management, and weather forecasting. They are working with local partners to develop AI solutions that can transform the continent. One project, the Open Buildings initiative, aims to create a database of building footprints in Africa to help with urban planning and disaster response. Google is also using advanced machine learning to predict floods and provide accurate weather forecasts. Their investment in AI research in Africa is focused on solving urgent challenges like poverty, disease, and hunger.
The importance of data in digital trade is also gaining recognition. Countries like Thailand are exploring new agreements and considering the risks involved in negotiating digital trade relationships. Issues like cybersecurity, government procurement, consumer protection, fairness, and the environment need attention. It is important for the government and the community to have a say in the creation and finalization of free trade agreements to ensure that power is balanced and controlled.
In the United States, the Department of Defense has released its 2023 Data, Analytics, and AI Adoption Strategy. The strategy aims to speed up the use of data, analytics, and AI, with a strong focus on using data effectively. The goal is to provide defense leaders with high-quality data so they can make quick and informed decisions. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of managing data properly and using data &ldquo;lakehouses&rdquo; to ensure clean and reliable data for successful AI. The Department is also addressing the shortage of AI experts by prioritizing hiring and providing access to learning resources.
The insurance industry is also exploring the use of AI and machine learning. The Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Working Group of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners recently met to discuss how AI and machine learning can be used in the industry. The group will focus on evaluating the use of AI and machine learning in insurance and creating more detailed guidelines.
Artificial intelligence is also a top priority for chief data officers (CDOs) in federal agencies. According to a report by the Data Foundation and Deloitte, more than half of CDOs are already using AI, and 95% are considering adopting it in the next year. CDOs are looking into using AI and automation technologies to improve data management and prepare data for AI use. The report suggests providing more clarity on the role of CDOs in relation to AI and developing ethical guidelines and governance frameworks for adopting new technologies.
Businesses are also realizing the potential of AI. IBM predicts significant growth in AI by 2025 and identifies five AI trends, including organizations shifting from &ldquo;plus AI&rdquo; to &ldquo;AI plus&rdquo; and the importance of data in the C-Suite. In 2024, IBM will focus on helping businesses make the most of their AI adoption and transformation.
While progress is being made in using AI and data science to solve global challenges, there are also concerns. More than 100 Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) had mixed feelings about the outcomes of the 10th Conference of States Parties to the UN Convention against Corruption. They believe that conflicts between countries weakened many resolutions. However, they appreciated the steps taken to protect civic space and the progress made on important issues like whistleblower protection, gender, and public procurement. The CSOs called on countries to improve their laws, protect whistleblowers, and promote transparency and accountability.
In conclusion, open data, information, and AI are crucial for addressing global challenges and making a positive impact on society. Organizations, governments, and businesses are using AI and data science to tackle issues like climate change, poverty, and corruption. However, it is important for consumers to be aware of these practices and make sure they are used responsibly and ethically, with a focus on transparency, accessibility, and the public&rsquo;s needs. Public opinion plays a big role in shaping the impact of these practices, so it is important to promote a better understanding of open data and its implications.
