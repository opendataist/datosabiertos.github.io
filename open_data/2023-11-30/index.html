  <meta name="description" content="Salesforce, a top customer management company, released its Q3 results. They made $1.22 billion and revenue went up by 11%. CEO Marc Benioff talked about the Data Cloud&rsquo;s success. It had 140% more records and 220% more activations. Einstein GPT Copilots, an AI product, is also doing well. 17% of the Fortune 100 use it. Salesforce will keep transforming and making AI breakthroughs.
In medicine, a phase 2 study showed that roflumilast foam is safe and okay for seborrheic dermatitis. The foam goes right on the problem areas. It has few bad effects and works for all ages and hair types. It doesn&rsquo;t sting, burn, leave residue, or irritate, so it&rsquo;s a good treatment.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce are working together more. They will offer some Salesforce products on AWS Marketplace. They will also connect data and AI more. This will help customers manage their data and use AI in their apps. Salesforce will use Amazon Bedrock and more AWS. AWS will use Salesforce products like Data Cloud. They will also make buying easier, improve customer experiences, bring AWS data and AI to Salesforce&rsquo;s Einstein platform, and give developers new AWS tools.
In climate finance, the ONE Campaign found that many countries are not transparent about their climate finance commitments. From 2013 to 2021, two-thirds of the money promised by developed countries wasn&rsquo;t given or wasn&rsquo;t used for climate work. This shows the need for better rules and checks so countries have enough money for clean energy and resilience. The ONE Campaign also said that rich countries don&rsquo;t give enough money to emerging markets like Nigeria, Kenya, and Senegal.
All these things show how open data, information, and transparency are helping different industries. AI and customer management are getting better. Medical treatments are safe and work well. People want more honesty in climate finance. With more access and truth, we can make the world better for future generations.
