Welcome to today&rsquo;s Open Data Digest! We bring you the latest news and facts from around the world. Our goal is to keep you informed and help you understand the world better through open data. Let&rsquo;s dive into today&rsquo;s stories.
Solving City Problems with Data: NYPD&rsquo;s 104th Precinct
In New York City, the NYPD&rsquo;s 104th Precinct is working on parking issues. This year, they have towed 463 cars and expect to tow 700 by the end of the year. They are trying to manage over 25,000 parking complaints. Common problems include blocked hydrants and loud noise. This shows how the community and the precinct are working together to solve these problems, even with limited resources.
Revealing a Hidden Crisis: Gender-Based Violence in Afghanistan
New data shows that gender-based violence in Afghanistan is worse than we thought since the Taliban took over. There have been over 300 cases of femicide and 840 incidents of violence against women and girls. The real numbers are likely higher because of media restrictions and fear of speaking out. The Taliban&rsquo;s policies limit women&rsquo;s access to education, jobs, and public life. Despite these challenges, Afghan women continue to resist, often through online protests, highlighting serious mental health issues they face.
