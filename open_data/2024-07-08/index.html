  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Open Data Digest! We bring you the latest news on open data and how it affects our lives. Today, we look at new projects in space traffic, groundwater management, and healthcare, all powered by open and shareable information.
Richard DalBello, the director of the NOAA Office of Space Commerce, talks about the important role of space traffic management. This helps the growing commercial space sector. The Office of Space Commerce is developing the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS). This is a new platform that gives satellite operators important information and warnings. TraCSS promotes voluntary rules for space operations, making space activities safer and more transparent. This project shows how commercial skills and teamwork can help the US space industry grow sustainably. TraCSS is expected to be ready by the end of Fiscal Year 2024.
In Ukiah Valley, a helicopter with special equipment is surveying the groundwater basin. This new method helps us understand the structure of aquifers, which is important for sustainable groundwater management. The data collected will help create Groundwater Sustainability Plans and find sites for groundwater recharge projects. The survey results will be available on the California Natural Resources Open Data Portal within six to eight months. This project gives residents important information and encourages teamwork for managing water resources sustainably.
In healthcare, more prescribers in the US are switching to e-prescribing. Some states are even thinking about making e-prescribing mandatory for non-controlled prescriptions. This change is part of a larger effort to improve health IT infrastructure, a trend sped up by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Finnish healthcare system is a good example, showing the benefits of strong digital health solutions. Also, the move towards value-based payment models in healthcare is gaining speed. This highlights the role of policy in shaping public health outcomes. The Affordable Care Act continues to influence healthcare providers and legal departments.
Today&rsquo;s stories show the power of open data in different fields. From space traffic management to groundwater practices and healthcare improvements, open and shareable information drives innovation. It also promotes a more transparent and collaborative world. Knowing about open data projects can make a big difference. Understanding these practices helps people and communities use the power of open information to create a better, more sustainable future.
Public perception is key to the success of open data projects. When people see the benefits of open data, they are more likely to support and engage with these practices. For instance, the success of Finland&rsquo;s digital health solutions has positively influenced public perception, leading to widespread acceptance. Similarly, the transparency of groundwater data in California has empowered residents to take part in sustainable water management.
Stay tuned for more updates and insights in our next edition of the Daily Open Data Digest!
