  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, we have some exciting updates on the open data front. Toitū Te Whenua, in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), is making 20TB of aerial imagery freely available to the public on the cloud. This is a significant development as it allows scientists, researchers, and governments from around the world to access high-resolution urban imagery, emergency response imagery, and decades of rural-scale aerial imagery. The partnership with AWS has drastically reduced the time it takes to retrieve aerial data, making it more accessible and efficient for various purposes such as climate change planning, land development, and agriculture.
In another collaboration, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) have signed an MoU to work together on data-driven innovations in agriculture and food systems. This partnership aims to improve the lives of smallholder farmers by sharing open-source data for product development, technology transfer, and agrarian policy-making. Nabard is building a data warehouse that will collect data from various sources, including UNDP, research houses, and agricultural universities. This collaboration also includes the dissemination of a digital public good called DiCRA, which provides satellite data and analytics for climate-resilient agriculture decision-making.
On the political data front, the Trivedi Centre for Political Data at Ashoka University has dissolved its scientific board, alleging that its founder and director, Gilles Verniers, was forced to leave. The university, however, stated that Verniers&#39; departure was due to him not meeting the criteria for continuation of service. The Trivedi Centre for Political Data provided open-access data and analysis of Indian elections, and its dissolution raises questions about the future of open data in political research.
Moving on to the world of venture capital, NordicNinja, the largest Japanese venture capital firm in Europe, has announced a second €200 million fund to invest in climate and deep technologies. The firm focuses on companies that tackle the world&rsquo;s biggest problems, with an emphasis on climate tech, deeptech, and digital society. NordicNinja believes that Northern Europe is home to the global leaders needed to drive the transition to a more sustainable world. This fund aims to provide these leaders with access to Japan&rsquo;s global networks of investors and companies, as well as VC partners with a successful track record in building tech companies.
In the technology sector, Fortis Capital Advisors LLC has increased its holdings in Veeva Systems Inc., a cloud-based software provider for the life sciences industry. Veeva Systems reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter, with revenue up 10.5% compared to the same quarter last year. This highlights the importance of data and information in driving business growth and decision-making.
Lastly, we have an update from the renewable energy sector. The annual RE Plus renewable energy Conference is taking place in Las Vegas, with thousands of clean energy professionals attending. However, there are concerns about the event&rsquo;s keynote speaker, Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff, who is expected to promote the expansion of the solar energy industry by Korean manufacturer Hanwha Q-Cells. Hanwha Q-Cells has been accused of having connections to forced labor in the Xinjiang region of China. It is crucial for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to enforce the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and ensure that all companies are held accountable for their actions.
That&rsquo;s all for today&rsquo;s news digest on open data. Stay informed, stay empowered, and remember that access to data, information, and knowledge is essential for a transparent and accessible society.
