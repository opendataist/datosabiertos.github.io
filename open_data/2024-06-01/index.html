  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Daily Open Data Digest! We bring you the latest news and updates in open data. Today&rsquo;s topics include conservation, public safety, healthcare, transportation, and technology. Let&rsquo;s explore the stories shaping our world.
Anita Arjundas talks about an exciting team-up between tech experts and wildlife groups. Projects like RE-FOREST-ER and CoRE Stack in India use robots, drones, and sensors to help save nature. The Internet of Wild Things is changing how we watch animals. New tech like bioremediation and crowdsourced monitoring are also making big steps. Open-source tech and facial recognition for animals are new trends. ATREE&rsquo;s community projects and online databases show how tech can solve conservation problems and help local people.
Recently, Avon and Somerset police fixed their records about stopping and searching kids under 10. They first said it was 117 times, but it was really only two. Across all police forces, the correct number is 317 searches, not 432. The article also corrected info on drug searches and the National Citizen Service. The Observer asks readers to report any mistakes, showing how important accurate info is for public safety.
E-prescribing is becoming more popular in the US. Some states might make it required for non-controlled prescriptions. Finland&rsquo;s healthcare system and COVID-19&rsquo;s impact on health IT are also in focus. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is moving to value-based payment models, influenced by the Affordable Care Act. Nedra Garrett from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention talks about how policy and public health are connected, showing how data-driven healthcare can change things for the better.
New data ranks Powys railway stations, showing many stations have more delays than on-time trains. Machynlleth and Llandrindod are the most reliable, while Welshpool and Newtown have fewer on-time trains. Builth Road ranks low, with only 43% of trains on time and up to 14% delayed by over ten minutes. Data sources include National Rail, Network Rail, NaPTAN, ORR Station Usage, and the Open Rail Data Community, showing the need for clear and accurate transportation data.
Snowflake Inc. faces challenges in growing its data cloud vision. It aims to be a leader in AI and a platform for data apps. The company needs to add generative AI, innovate quickly, and balance profits to stay competitive. Snowflake is changing from a cloud data warehouse to a data cloud. This involves managing open data formats and controlling data catalogs. Success depends on separating metadata governance from data management, adding generative AI, and improving data interoperability. Comparing to competitors like Databricks and Salesforce, Snowflake needs smart moves to keep its market value and growth.
Today&rsquo;s stories show the power of open data in different areas. From conservation to public safety, healthcare, transportation, and technology, using data well can bring positive changes. As we keep using information and insights, we move closer to a better world for future generations.
