  <meta name="description" content="Raxio, a company from the US that works with data, has opened a new center in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. This center is in the Ethio ICT Park and can hold up to 800 racks and has 3 MW of IT power. Raxio wants to meet the growing need for good IT solutions in the area and attract local and international service providers. This new center also shows Raxio&rsquo;s commitment to being kind to the environment and being open about what they do.
In another story, a startup from Ireland called Silicate is doing a test in Illinois to see if using dust from concrete can help take carbon dioxide out of the air. They plan to spread 500 to 1,000 tons of dust from ready-mix concrete on over 100 acres of farmland. Silicate hopes this will take out up to 220 tons of carbon dioxide from the air and put it in the soil over a year. This new way of getting rid of carbon dioxide could be a long-term and cheap way to help with climate change.
Now, Northern Trust Corp has lowered how much of a company called Veeva Systems Inc. they own. Veeva Systems makes software for the life sciences industry that is stored in the cloud. Northern Trust Corp now has 885,235 shares of Veeva Systems&#39; stock, which is worth $175,038,000. Other companies that invest money have also changed how much of the company they own. Veeva Systems recently had better-than-expected earnings, and people who work for the company have been selling their shares. People who work on Wall Street think Veeva Systems is a good buy and have a price target of $218.83.
These three stories show how important data, information, and being open are in today&rsquo;s world. Raxio&rsquo;s new data center in Ethiopia gives businesses a place to store and use a lot of data, so they can make good choices. Silicate&rsquo;s test with concrete dust shows how important data and knowledge are in finding new ways to help with big problems like climate change. And Northern Trust Corp changing how much of Veeva Systems they own shows how the technology industry is always changing, and it&rsquo;s important to have good information to make good choices.
All of these stories show how easy it is to get data and how important it is to shape a better future. Whether it&rsquo;s through data centers, new ways to take out carbon dioxide, or software stored in the cloud, data is very powerful. If we are open and share data, we can keep making good changes and make the world better for the next generation.
