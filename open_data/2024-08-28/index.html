  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Open Data Digest! Here, we talk about the latest news in open data and how it affects our world. Today, we&rsquo;ll look at air quality, data accessibility challenges, and the importance of fair healthcare. Let&rsquo;s get started!
A recent report has some surprising and hopeful news: air pollution in South Asia went down by 18% in 2022. This helped lower global air pollution by 9%. Better weather played a part in this improvement, which has also helped people live longer in the region. However, South Asia still has the most polluted air in the world, which harms people&rsquo;s health.
The report shows that we need to keep checking air quality, enforcing rules, and investing in air quality data. While countries like China have made progress, many places still don&rsquo;t meet the World Health Organization&rsquo;s guidelines. Without enough data, it&rsquo;s hard to make good policies. So, we need more monitoring and funding to tackle air pollution&rsquo;s health effects worldwide.
In other news, Elon Musk&rsquo;s xAI is facing criticism for its new data center in Memphis, Tennessee. The center uses gas turbines, which have been blamed for making the city&rsquo;s smog worse. Environmental groups are worried about the lack of proper permits and the pollution from the turbines. This issue is part of a larger trend of environmental concerns with AI data centers in the tech industry.
A study by UCL researchers found that pain is the most common and severe symptom in long Covid patients. Other common symptoms are mental issues, tiredness, and shortness of breath. Symptoms, especially pain, have gotten worse over time. Factors like age, gender, ethnicity, education level, and income affect how bad the symptoms are.
The study highlights the need for special help and support for long Covid patients. It calls for ongoing support for long Covid clinics and treatments that focus on pain management. It&rsquo;s important to fix gaps in healthcare policies to give fair care to all patients.
Veeva Systems has updated its earnings guidance for FY25. They expect earnings per share of $6.22 and revenue between $2.704 and $2.710 billion. The company&rsquo;s stock was traded at $199.35, with a market cap of $32.22 billion. Veeva Systems offers cloud-based software for the life sciences industry, including CRM and analytics solutions. Their products are used by pharmaceutical and biotech companies, showing the growing importance of data in healthcare.
Digital data from CERN&rsquo;s old LEP accelerator holds valuable scientific information but faces the risk of becoming outdated. Former collaborators and digital archaeologists are working to save and share this data by updating old software. They have made ALEPH and DELPHI data accessible and plan to make more data available. This effort lets researchers and others explore electron-positron annihilation data on the CERN Open Data Portal.
The South Korean government plans to let private companies access biodata from public research institutions starting in 2025. To ensure proper data sharing, institutions will need Data Management Plans (DMPs) for each project. The Ministry of Science and ICT aims to improve data accessibility with initiatives like the National Bio Data Station and promoting metadata registration. They discussed research topics for the Advanced Bio Initiative and expect detailed plans by the end of the year.
Today&rsquo;s stories show how open data can help solve global problems, from improving air quality to advancing healthcare and preserving scientific knowledge. As we keep sharing and using data, we get closer to making a better world for future generations. Stay tuned for more updates on how open data affects our daily lives.
Thank you for joining us in today&rsquo;s Daily Open Data Digest. Together, we can make a difference by staying informed and advocating for a healthier, fairer world.
