  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Daily Open Data Digest! We&rsquo;re here to share the latest news, facts, and figures from the world of open data. Our goal is to keep you updated on the changes and projects that are making the world better. Here are today&rsquo;s top stories:
Veeva Systems Inc. is a big name in cloud software for the life sciences industry. They recently reported great financial results, with earnings per share (EPS) of $1.03, which is better than expected. Their stock is worth $200, and the company has a market value of $31.84 billion. Big investors like Norges Bank and Vanguard Group believe in Veeva&rsquo;s future and have bought more shares. Veeva&rsquo;s tools, like CRM and analytics, help pharmaceutical and biotech companies manage content and data. This shows how important data is for progress in healthcare and life sciences.
Servants of Knowledge (SoK), led by Carl Malamud, is doing great work in open data activism. They have digitized 12,000 books from the Gandhi Bhavan library in Bengaluru, making them free for everyone. This collection includes Gandhi&rsquo;s writings in 12 languages and 129 audio files of Gandhiji. SoK&rsquo;s work shows how important it is to make data easy to find and use, so knowledge is saved for the future. With over 1 lakh books digitized and viewed by 50 crore people, SoK keeps sharing data through collaborations and training at their Knowledge Academy.
In Corporate India, many people want to become independent directors, but there are not enough positions. This is because of new board rules and the need for women directors. Even though there are many registered independent directors, companies look for people with special skills and experience, making it hard to find the right candidates. The lack of data on demand makes it even harder, showing the need for better information to match candidates with jobs.
Australian startup BillWill is using open banking technology to help families manage bills after a loved one dies. Founded by Colin Jowell, who was inspired by his own experience, BillWill talks to billing companies to make the process easier. For a yearly fee of $45 and a one-time setup fee of $149, this service reduces stress for families. It also helps financial planners and lawyers serve their clients better. This shows how data and technology can make life easier.
SIBUR, Russia&rsquo;s top polymer and rubber producer, has earned the highest ESG rating, AAA.esg, from the National Rating Agency. SIBUR is the first company in Russia to get this top rating in all sectors. Their great work in environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and corporate governance was highlighted, including efforts in reducing emissions and promoting the circular economy. SIBUR&rsquo;s focus on employee well-being, community engagement, and transparent practices sets a high standard for sustainability.
Smart Communications, with ZTE Corp., is working to increase 5G use in the Philippines by launching the affordable Smart ZTE Blade A75 5G phone. Priced at P5,450, this phone has advanced features, like a 50MP dual AI camera and a 6.6-inch display. Since only 10% of devices in the country are 5G-capable, this project aims to make advanced technology available to more people. Smart also offers prepaid bundles and installment plans to make it easier for users, promising a future where 5G is available to everyone.
Understanding open data projects is important. These efforts make information available to everyone, driving innovation and transparency in many areas. People should know about these projects because they empower individuals and communities, creating a more informed and fair society.
Public support is key to the success of open data projects. When people see the value of accessible information, they are more likely to support and use these efforts. For example, the digitization of Gandhi&rsquo;s works by SoK has been widely appreciated, showing the cultural and educational benefits of open data. Similarly, BillWill&rsquo;s use of open banking technology has been praised for helping with administrative tasks during tough times.
Stay tuned for more updates and insights as we continue to explore the world of open data and its impact on our lives. Together, we can use the power of information to create a better world for future generations.
