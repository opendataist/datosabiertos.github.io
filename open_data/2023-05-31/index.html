A new study published in Science Advances shows that large-scale, fully-protected marine areas (MPAs) can protect biodiversity without negatively impacting fishing and food security. The study analyzed the impact of Mexico&rsquo;s Revillagigedo National Park on the fishing industry and found that the industrial fishing sector did not incur economic losses despite a full ban on fishing activity within the MPA. The study also refutes the argument made by the fishing industry that MPAs harm their catches. The findings highlight the effectiveness of MPAs in promoting sustainable and equitable use of the ocean.
