  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Open Data Digest. We bring you the latest news on open data, analytics, and digital change. Our goal is to keep you informed and excited about how data can make a better future for everyone.
Oracle has introduced the Oracle Intelligent Data Lake at Oracle CloudWorld. This new feature will launch in 2025. It will bring together data from many sources, using tools like Apache Spark and Jupyter Notebook. Oracle wants to improve data management and decision-making with this new tool. They also have new features for their Oracle Analytics Cloud AI Assistant and Oracle Autonomous Database.
U.S. Global Investors, Inc. reported $11 million in operating revenues and $1.3 million in net income for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Even though the economy was tough and they managed fewer assets, their net investment income grew by 578%. The company is hopeful about the airline industry&rsquo;s growth and has expanded globally. They also expect more demand for gold as interest rates may drop.
The European Union Open Data Portal shows that the Czech Republic&rsquo;s labor market has worsened for the third year in a row. It ranks tenth worst in the EU. Even though it has the lowest unemployment rate, the country struggles with issues like part-time work for parents and gender pay gaps. Meanwhile, countries like the Netherlands, Austria, and Scandinavian nations have the best work conditions.
Data center operators in Nigeria are facing a foreign exchange crisis. The naira&rsquo;s value against the U.S. dollar is unstable, making it hard to stay profitable. Costs for electricity, diesel, and maintenance are also rising. Despite these problems, Nigeria&rsquo;s data center capacity is growing with new projects from companies like OADC and MTN. These projects are important for Nigeria&rsquo;s digital economy, but the currency issue is a big challenge.
Malaysia needs to make bold changes to improve its global competitiveness. The country dropped from 27th to 34th in the World Competitiveness Ranking. Chief Secretary Tan Sri Shamsul Azri Abu Bakar says Malaysia should focus on digital infrastructure and cloud computing. Civil servants should show loyalty, integrity, and professionalism to support the Prime Minister&rsquo;s efforts against corruption. The values of MALAYSIA—Mesra, Adil, Luhur, Amanah, Yakin, Setia, Islah, and Arif—should guide these reforms.
The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) launched a new open access database. It provides detailed statistics on water management and energy production in Africa. Their research shows the demand for freshwater for electricity in Africa in 2020. As Africa&rsquo;s population grows, this data is key for sustainable development. The study also looks at how different energy sources use water and the impact of climate change on hydropower. By making this data free, IWMI helps people make better decisions for Africa&rsquo;s future.
Today&rsquo;s news shows how powerful data can be in solving global problems and creating a better future. From Oracle&rsquo;s new data tools to IWMI&rsquo;s open database, data has the potential to drive positive change. As we face economic challenges and aim for sustainable development, open data is a crucial tool for making informed decisions and progress.
Stay tuned for more updates in our next edition of the Daily Open Data Digest. Together, we can use the power of data to create a brighter future for everyone.
