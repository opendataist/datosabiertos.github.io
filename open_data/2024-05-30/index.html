  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Daily Open Data Digest! We bring you the latest news on open data and how it affects different areas. Our goal is to give you the important information you need. Let&rsquo;s look at today&rsquo;s top stories.
Universal Avionics has launched the KAPTURE CVR. This is a new cockpit voice and flight data recorder that can record for 25 hours. It works well with modern cockpit tools and meets aviation rules. The KAPTURE system has a special power pack that needs no upkeep and meets EASA rules. It also has optional features like an Underwater Locator Beacon. This device will make it easier for aviation experts to access and use data.
The Venture Catalyst Space program in South Australia has welcomed four new space startups. One of them, KC Research &amp; Solutions, works on making insulin in space. Supported by the University of South Australia and government funds, these startups aim to change the space industry with new ideas like satellite communications, wildfire detection, and new fuel tanks. The program also started a Growth Ramp path to help space companies grow, develop talent, and boost the space industry.
High food prices in Canada are a big problem for food security. These high prices are due to global events and supply chain issues. Reports on these price hikes often lack good research and miss key factors like environmental impacts and private sector roles. Experts call for clear government-grocer relations and peer-reviewed studies to find out why food costs are rising. We need a full plan to make sure food stays affordable and Canadians stay healthy.
Virgin Trains Ticketing wants political parties to make sure rail prices are fair for all passengers, no matter where they buy tickets. A survey of 2,000 passengers showed many are confused and frustrated by fare limits set by train operators. The company&rsquo;s &lsquo;Charter for Change&rsquo; calls for equal access to fares, clear data sharing, and better Delay Repay services. Passengers want the best fare but find current pricing too complex. They want live data for deals and a simple system with fair prices.
A study on fruit flies and parasitoid wasps in space showed surprising effects on immune gene activity and tumor growth. Flies without tumors were more affected by spaceflight, while those with tumors had more tumor growth. Parasitoid wasps stayed harmful in space, with some developing changes that affected their egg-laying ability. This research helps us understand host-parasite interactions in space and shows the need to study different organisms to protect astronaut health. The findings are available for further research.
The global movement for researchers to access data from digital platforms is growing. This is important for transparency, human rights, and election integrity. While the EU and the US have made progress, data access is still a problem, especially in the global south. Researchers in South Africa struggle to monitor social media due to limited data access from tech companies. Efforts are being made to improve access through legal means and international initiatives, but challenges remain. The fight for data access and transparency continues.
Early warning systems are key for disaster preparedness and saving lives. Japan&rsquo;s Earthquake Early Warning system has been effective in giving timely alerts. The UN&rsquo;s EW4AII initiative aims to protect everyone globally with early warning systems by 2027. The World Water Forum stresses the need for early warnings for natural disasters, including water crises. Cooperation at all levels is needed for success. Investing in early warning systems is cost-effective and vital for reducing disaster impacts, though challenges like funding and equipment installation exist.
Australia leads in rooftop solar per capita but faces issues due to different digital standards. The Albanese Government will invest $1.6 million through ARENA to create a common digital platform for solar, batteries, and other energy resources. This aims to unlock $6 billion in benefits over 20 years by helping consumers interact with the grid. AEMO will develop an Open Data Exchange to collect more data on clean energy tech, ensuring efficient use and grid connection. This effort supports the government&rsquo;s plan for reliable renewables, helping consumers get the most from their energy tech.
Ordnance Survey (OS) has teamed up with the British Geological Survey (BGS) to add geological data products to the OS Data Hub. This makes it easier for users to access geospatial data. This is the first time products from another government data partner are available on the platform. Funded by the Government Office of Technology Transfer, this aims to give developers and specialists a wider range of geospatial data. The nine BGS datasets cover various geological aspects like rock types, ground instability, and hydrogeology, supporting many users in public and private sectors.
The New Zealand Fintech Fund (NZFF) has made its first three investments in fintech startups. This aims to boost the sector with an open data bill. The fund, led by industry experts, plans to invest between $100,000 and $500,000 in early-stage firms. The startups get help to navigate banking rules. The Consumer and Product Data Bill 2024 is expected to help new digital payment apps and lending options emerge. Despite a recent drop in fintech funding, NZFF aims to bridge the gap by providing capital and expertise to the sector.
The Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) has introduced Open DAGIR. This new approach integrates data, analytics, and AI in a government-owned ecosystem. This aims to keep government data ownership while maximizing industry collaboration. Open DAGIR supports the Department&rsquo;s data infrastructure for CJADC2 and enables quick onboarding of third-party capabilities. The CDAO plans to use industry expertise through the Global Information Dominance Experiment series, offering new solutions for DoD challenges. The goal is to use industry talent to develop software for decision advantage and national security.
