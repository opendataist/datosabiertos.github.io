Organized by UNESCO and the Government of Ghana, the event emphasized the significance of data availability and transparency in facilitating access to information and upholding universal access to information.  Participants recognized that a just and informed society in the digital age relies heavily on the availability and transparency of data, including statistics, datasets, reports, research findings, and data collected by public bodies and private institutions. They acknowledged that data is a crucial pillar of the right to information, which is essential for democracy and promotes transparent, accountable, efficient, and responsive institutions.  The conference participants stressed that access to data should be openly available, easily discoverable, accessible, shared, and disseminated by anyone within the framework of international human rights law. They noted that data harnessing is increasingly shaping daily lives and impacting global technological, socio-economic, and political dynamics.  The participants believed that access to data provides insights to inform evidence-based policies and interventions, enabling governments, citizens, researchers, civil society, and private sector organizations to make better-informed decisions, especially during elections. They also emphasized that open data initiatives and access to data for the public good can foster innovation, encourage collaboration, and empower the public to engage actively in governance and decision-making processes.  The conference participants recognized the role of media practitioners in utilizing data to inform and guide the public on important matters affecting public interest. They also acknowledged the critical role of timely data access in addressing global challenges such as pandemics, climate change, environmental crises, and conflicts.
