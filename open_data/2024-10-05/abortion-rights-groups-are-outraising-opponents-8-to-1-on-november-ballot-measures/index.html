  <meta name="description" content=" Abortion-rights supporters have significantly outpaced their opponents in fundraising for ballot measures across the U.S., with nearly $108 million raised compared to $14 million. However, this financial advantage may not guarantee more spending in the final weeks before the November 5 elections.  In states like Missouri and Montana, the funding disparity has led to a significant difference in ad spending, with pro-amendment groups investing over $11 million, while opponents have spent less than $50,000. In contrast, ad activity in states like Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Nevada, and South Dakota has been less pronounced.  Florida presents unique challenges for abortion-rights supporters. The amendment requires approval from 60% of voters, a higher threshold than in other states. Despite raising more than $60 million, the opposition has received support from the GOP and the state government, which has spent $9.6 million on ads against the amendment.  The fundraising gap is partly due to the lack of involvement from two major national organizations, The Concord Fund and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which spent heavily in Ohio last year but have not heavily invested in this year s campaigns.  Overall, while abortion-rights supporters have raised more money and have more donors, the final outcome of the elections may not be solely determined by campaign spending. Legal battles and signature drives have also added to the costs of the campaigns, potentially affecting the distribution of funds."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://datosabiertos.com/open_data/2024-10-05/abortion-rights-groups-are-outraising-opponents-8-to-1-on-november-ballot-measures/">
