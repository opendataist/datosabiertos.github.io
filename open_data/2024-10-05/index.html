  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s world, information is very powerful. The International Day for Universal Access to Information conference in Accra, Ghana, focused on how important open data is for creating a fair society. UNESCO and the Government of Ghana organized this event. They brought together leaders and supporters who talked about how data transparency helps democracy and good governance.
In the digital age, having access to information is crucial for making smart decisions. Open data helps people innovate and work together. It also increases public involvement and engagement. When citizens have free access to information, they can hold public institutions accountable and build trust.
At the conference, people talked about how open data can solve global problems. It gives the knowledge needed for policies based on facts and helps people exercise their rights. Communities can make sure that institutions are transparent and meet public needs.
Open data is not just about technology. It helps create a future where everyone can take part in and benefit from a fair society. People need to know about these efforts because they affect how societies work and grow. Public opinion is important for the success of open data. When people understand and trust these efforts, they are more likely to take part and help.
For example, in Kenya, the Open Data Initiative started in 2011 to make government data available to everyone. At first, people were unsure and worried that the information might be misused. But as the initiative showed transparency and accountability, people’s views changed. Citizens began using the data to push for better services and policies, showing how informed communities can make a difference.
In the UK, open data has changed public services. By sharing health data, the government helped researchers and developers create apps that improve patient care and resource use. People saw real benefits from these efforts, which improved their opinion of open data and highlighted the importance of transparency.
Understanding open data helps people and communities take an active role in society&rsquo;s growth. By recognizing how public opinion affects open data, we can make sure these efforts lead to real and lasting change.

    <br/> Abortion-rights supporters have significantly outpaced their opponents in fundraising for ballot measures across the U.S., with nearly $108 million raised compared to $14 million. However, this financial advantage may not guarantee more spending in the final weeks before the November 5 elections.  In states like Missouri and Montana, the funding disparity has led to a significant difference in ad spending, with pro-amendment groups investing over $11 million, while opponents have spent less than $50,000. In contrast, ad activity in states like Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Nevada, and South Dakota has been less pronounced.  Florida presents unique challenges for abortion-rights supporters. The amendment requires approval from 60% of voters, a higher threshold than in other states. Despite raising more than $60 million, the opposition has received support from the GOP and the state government, which has spent $9.6 million on ads against the amendment.  The fundraising gap is partly due to the lack of involvement from two major national organizations, The Concord Fund and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which spent heavily in Ohio last year but have not heavily invested in this year s campaigns.  Overall, while abortion-rights supporters have raised more money and have more donors, the final outcome of the elections may not be solely determined by campaign spending. Legal battles and signature drives have also added to the costs of the campaigns, potentially affecting the distribution of funds.

    <br/> The International Day for Universal Access to Information (IDUAI) conference held in Accra, Ghana, from October 1-2, 2024, highlighted the importance of access to information as a cornerstone for a just, informed, and equitable society in the digital era. Organized by UNESCO and the Government of Ghana, the event emphasized the significance of data availability and transparency in facilitating access to information and upholding universal access to information.  Participants recognized that a just and informed society in the digital age relies heavily on the availability and transparency of data, including statistics, datasets, reports, research findings, and data collected by public bodies and private institutions. They acknowledged that data is a crucial pillar of the right to information, which is essential for democracy and promotes transparent, accountable, efficient, and responsive institutions.  The conference participants stressed that access to data should be openly available, easily discoverable, accessible, shared, and disseminated by anyone within the framework of international human rights law. They noted that data harnessing is increasingly shaping daily lives and impacting global technological, socio-economic, and political dynamics.  The participants believed that access to data provides insights to inform evidence-based policies and interventions, enabling governments, citizens, researchers, civil society, and private sector organizations to make better-informed decisions, especially during elections. They also emphasized that open data initiatives and access to data for the public good can foster innovation, encourage collaboration, and empower the public to engage actively in governance and decision-making processes.  The conference participants recognized the role of media practitioners in utilizing data to inform and guide the public on important matters affecting public interest. They also acknowledged the critical role of timely data access in addressing global challenges such as pandemics, climate change, environmental crises, and conflicts.  In conclusion, the IDUAI conference participants reaffirmed the importance of data access in promoting transparency, accountability, and public participation in governance. They highlighted the need for mechanisms, policies, and practices that ensure accountability and support the design and evaluation of progress towards achieving the Sust
