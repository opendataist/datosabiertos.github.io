  <meta name="description" content="The 2024 elections in Ghana are coming soon, and the competition between politicians is getting more intense. John Dramani Mahama is representing the National Democratic Congress (NDC), while Mahamudu Bawumia is the flagbearer for the New Patriotic Party (NPP). Other candidates, like John Alan Kyeremanten, are also gaining attention.
To make sure the elections are fair and clear, the Electoral Commission (EC) of Ghana plays a very important role. They can use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to make things better. For example, they can use e-voting systems, online registration for candidates and parties, and cybersecurity measures. These things can make the electoral process in Ghana better.
In other news, HF Advisory Group LLC has bought more shares in Veeva Systems Inc., a technology company that helps the life sciences industry. Other big investors, like Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. Ltd Zurich and Vanguard Group Inc., have also bought and sold shares of Veeva Systems. This shows that more people are interested in the company and its solutions, like customer relationship management and analytics.
The mortgage industry is also using technology more. Experts think that 2024 will be an important year for using technology in this industry. One Mortgage System (OMS) is a platform that helps brokers and lenders with all their needs. They recently hosted an event called Tech Talks, where experts talked about the importance of using technology and getting ready for the future.
All of these things show that data, information, and technology are becoming more important in many different areas. Whether it&rsquo;s elections, the life sciences industry, or mortgages, using technology and open data can make things better. It&rsquo;s important for people and companies to use these advancements and stay ahead in this digital age.
