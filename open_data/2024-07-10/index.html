  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s issue of our Open Data Digest. Here, we share the latest news and insights from the world of open data. Our goal is to give you the knowledge that matters, helping you make smart choices for a better future. Let&rsquo;s jump into today&rsquo;s highlights.
E2open, a top provider of cloud-based supply chain solutions, has shared its financial results for Q1 2025. The company reported a GAAP subscription revenue of $131.4 million. This shows strong cash flow and a focus on steady growth. E2open works hard to keep clients happy, leading to better satisfaction and longer contracts, even though there were some delays in deals.
The financial outlook for FY 2025 looks good. The company has confirmed its goals for subscription revenue, total revenue, gross profit margin, and adjusted EBITDA. E2open&rsquo;s focus on client growth and better operations shows its confidence in staying strong in the market.
The State of California&rsquo;s 2023 Drinking Water Needs Assessment has raised big concerns in San Diego County. The report found that 18 water systems failed tests due to various contaminants. Another 16 systems are at risk. Failing a test doesn&rsquo;t always mean the water is unsafe; it could be due to money issues or temporary problems.
For communities in need, there is hope. The SAFER program offers state grants to improve water quality. This helps ensure that all residents have access to safe and clean drinking water. This program is a key step in fixing differences in water quality and protecting public health.
At the heart of these updates is the power of open data. By making information and records accessible, we can drive positive change and empower communities. Whether it&rsquo;s understanding financial numbers to make better business choices or looking at water quality data to push for safer drinking water, open data gives us the insights needed to create a better world for future generations.
People should know about open data because it promotes transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making. When communities have access to relevant data, they can spot issues, push for change, and hold institutions accountable. This awareness can lead to fairer and more effective solutions to societal challenges.
Public trust is key to the success of open data projects. When people trust the data and the processes behind it, they are more likely to engage and support these efforts. For example, in California&rsquo;s water quality issues, public trust in the data can drive community action and policy changes to fix the problems.
Consider New York City&rsquo;s open data portal. It has changed how residents interact with their city. By giving access to a wide range of data sets, the portal has allowed citizens to track everything from school performance to crime rates. This transparency has increased public trust and engagement, leading to more informed and active communities.
In another example, the UK&rsquo;s National Health Service (NHS) uses open data to improve healthcare. By making patient outcomes and hospital performance data public, the NHS has helped patients make informed choices about their care. This transparency has also led to better healthcare services, as providers strive to meet higher standards.
Thank you for joining us in today&rsquo;s Open Data Digest. Stay tuned for more updates and keep using the power of information to drive positive change.
