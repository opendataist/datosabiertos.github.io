  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, we have some interesting developments in the world of open data. Let&rsquo;s dive right in and see what&rsquo;s been happening.
First up, we have Moo0 File Shredder, a free and open-source data shredding tool for Windows PCs. This software allows users to securely delete their files using three different erasure algorithms. While it may not have all the bells and whistles of other data shredding tools, Moo0 File Shredder gets the job done. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the software is limited to Windows PCs and is not compatible with the latest version, Windows 11. Despite these limitations, Moo0 File Shredder remains a reliable option for those looking to securely delete their data.
Next, we have Cognizant, a technology company that has partnered with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank to rebuild their digital banking system on Google Cloud. This migration will not only help the bank scale its usage costs but also simplify customer data management. By utilizing Google Cloud&rsquo;s analytics solution, BigQuery, and AI platform, Vertex AI, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank are taking steps towards a more efficient and transparent banking experience. This move is part of the bank&rsquo;s ongoing cloud and data transformation journey, with the goal of having 50% of its business in the cloud by FY24.
In the healthcare sector, Australian startup PatientNotes is using generative AI to revolutionize the way doctors take notes and write referral letters. This platform transcribes and writes clinical notes, patient summaries, and referral letters using AI technology. With a focus on patient safety and privacy, PatientNotes ensures that data is deleted after 30 days and encrypted both in transit and at rest. Additionally, the platform offers automatic translation of letters into different languages. This innovative tool has seen significant growth since its soft launch and aims to make its services accessible to all medical practitioners.
Moving on to the financial sector, China Universal Asset Management Co. Ltd. has increased its holdings in Veeva Systems Inc. during the second quarter. This institutional investor now owns a significant number of shares in the technology company, highlighting their confidence in Veeva Systems&#39; potential. The company provides cloud-based software for the life sciences industry and recently reported strong quarterly earnings, surpassing analysts&#39; expectations. This positive performance has led to several equities research analysts issuing positive ratings and raising their price targets for Veeva Systems.
Lastly, we have an article discussing how blockchain technology can contribute to achieving specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to the energy sector. The SDGs, established by the United Nations, provide a framework for global efforts towards sustainable energy production and consumption. Blockchain applications can play a significant role in achieving these goals, including decentralized energy markets, traceability of sustainable production and consumption, microgrid development, renewable energy verification, transparent data management, and integration of blockchain into electric vehicles and green mobility. By leveraging blockchain technology, we can combat climate change and promote sustainable economic growth.
That&rsquo;s all for today&rsquo;s news digest on open data. Stay informed and keep exploring the world of data, information, and knowledge. Remember, transparency and accessibility are key in our journey towards a better future.
