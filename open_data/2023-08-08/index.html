  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, we have some interesting developments in the world of open data. Let&rsquo;s dive right in and see what&rsquo;s been happening.
First up, we have the Bharti Institute of Public Policy at the Indian School of Business (ISB) partnering with the Goa government to establish a knowledge partnership. This partnership aims to improve social and economic prosperity indicators through evidence-based policy formulation and impact. The institute will be conducting capacity-building workshops and citizen-centric governance initiatives, among other activities. This collaboration highlights the importance of data and information in driving positive change.
Moving on, Energy Secretary Grant Shapps has issued a stern warning to fuel retailers regarding the sharing of pump price data. With petrol prices experiencing the largest weekly increase in over a year, Shapps expects retailers to cooperate with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in publishing fuel prices. The government is also committed to developing a mandatory open data scheme for fuel retailers. This emphasizes the need for transparency and accessible information in the energy sector.
In the realm of technology, blockchain settlement system Ripple has joined the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), gaining access to the $1.2 quadrillion derivatives market. This comes after a recent court victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which saw Ripple&rsquo;s XRP token surge in value. There are now bullish predictions for XRP, with some suggesting it could rise significantly in the coming months. Additionally, Ripple has partnered with climate-focused tech provider Centigrade to boost the carbon credit market ecosystem. These developments highlight the potential of technology and data in driving innovation and sustainability.
Shifting our focus to New Zealand, we find a thriving data center market projected to reach a value of $1.7 billion by 2028. This growth is driven by investments in IT infrastructure, general construction, and tier standards. Key players in the market include AWS, Canberra Data Centres, Datacom, and Data Vault. New Zealand&rsquo;s emphasis on AI adoption, investments in submarine cables, and the Open Government Data program further demonstrate the nation&rsquo;s commitment to technological advancement. This presents potential opportunities for growth and investment in the country.
In the field of education, the Delaware Department of Education has released statewide assessment results for the 2022-23 school year. While there have been gains in certain districts and schools, the results indicate that students still need additional support as the state focuses on recovery efforts. The Department of Education is investing in academic and non-academic supports to help students succeed. This highlights the importance of data and statistics in identifying areas for improvement and driving educational progress.
Lastly, we have Natalie Meyers, a professor at the University of Notre Dame, joining the San Diego Supercomputer Center as a research specialist. Meyers&#39; expertise in FAIR data management and software preservation will contribute to various research projects, including the implementation of FAIR principles and integration with the Open Science Data Federation. This collaboration showcases the power of knowledge and collaboration in advancing scientific research.
That wraps up today&rsquo;s news digest on open data. From partnerships and warnings to market projections and educational assessments, it&rsquo;s clear that data, information, and knowledge are at the forefront of driving positive change and progress. Stay tuned for more updates on these exciting developments.
