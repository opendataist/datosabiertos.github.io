  <meta name="description" content="In the world of online security, hackers are getting better at avoiding detection in 2023. They focus on finding weak spots like &lsquo;zero-day&rsquo; flaws and poor security practices. France is at risk, especially VMWare, Cisco, Citrix, Atlassian, and Progress Software. ANSSI, the French cybersecurity agency, says it&rsquo;s important to watch out for sneaky threats like spying. They warn about efforts to cause problems between countries and steal business secrets.

The future of carbon capture will use robots and AI for better results.
In finance, Morningstar Investment Services LLC has sold some of its shares in Veeva Systems Inc. Other big investors, like Vanguard Group Inc., have bought more.

Tech expert Nik Zemke and a team made the One Fleet app to help rescue groups in the Mediterranean. The app uses drones and special tech to find and rescue migrants.

In the Philippines, TNT offers budget-friendly mobile deals like &lsquo;Sulit Saya&rsquo; to help people stay connected without spending too much.
As the world faces tough challenges and uses more tech, having good data and info is key. It&rsquo;s important for dealing with online threats, managing risks, making carbon capture better, investing smartly, helping in aid work, and improving mobile connections. By being open and using digital tools, groups and people can handle problems and make a safer future for everyone.
