  <meta name="description" content="Over 100 groups, including ARTICLE 19, want countries to focus on being open about how they spend money. This is important because governments spend a lot of money, over $13 trillion every year. The groups say it&rsquo;s important to use the best practices and new technology to be more open. They also say it&rsquo;s important to work together with different groups to achieve the Sustainable Development Agenda.
In Nigeria, the head of the National Population Commission (NPC) promises to give accurate information about the number of people in the country. The NPC has found 65 million houses and special groups of people, like those who had to leave their homes, for the upcoming census. The head of the NPC says they are taking steps to keep the information safe and they will have a special center for cybersecurity. Having accurate information about how many people live in the country is important for planning and doing things that help people.
A new study looked at how people learn to plan and focus. The study used information from over 10,000 people and found that people get better at planning and focusing by the time they are 18. The biggest improvements happen between the ages of 10 and 15, but there are still important changes happening until the teenage years are over. By the time people are 18 to 20, they are as good at planning and focusing as adults. This information is important for doctors, scientists, and teachers. It can also help us understand how different things affect how people grow and learn.
These stories show how important it is to have good information and be open about it. Whether it&rsquo;s about spending money, knowing how many people there are, or learning new things, having good information helps us make good choices. It&rsquo;s also important for different groups to work together to make things better. As we try to make the world better for future generations, being open with information is a big part of making things fair and equal for everyone.
