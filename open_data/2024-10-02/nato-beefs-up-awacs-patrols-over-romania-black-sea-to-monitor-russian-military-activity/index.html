  <meta name="description" content=" NATO has deployed advanced Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, specifically the Boeing E-3A Sentry, to monitor Russian military operations and enhance Romanian airspace defense. The flights, operating from Greece and the NATO AWACS main base at Geilenkirchen, are a response to repeated violations of Romanian airspace by Russian drones. This deployment, which includes a $270 million E-3A Sentry, is a significant move as it marks a rare commitment of such a capable air reconnaissance platform to the borders of the Russo-Ukrainian War.  The AWACS aircraft, capable of detecting aircraft-sized objects at hundreds of kilometers, process various forms of intelligence, including pilot voice intercepts, ground missile launches, and radar emissions. The recent intensified monitoring of NATO s southeastern tier, as evidenced by the Dutch E-3A Sentry s flights over Romania, is unprecedented in peacetime operations.  This deployment comes after the United States Air Force ceased reconnaissance missions using Global Hawk surveillance drones over the Black Sea, a move possibly linked to a June 25 telephone conversation between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov.  In the lead-up to potential Russian missile strikes on Ukraine, Russian Air Force planners are reportedly redeploying Tu-95MS strategic bombers at Engels-2 air base, near Saratov. If a NATO AWACS were present during such an attack, its sensors would likely detect every incoming aircraft, drone, and missile.  Overall, the deployment of NATO s AWACS aircraft to Romania s eastern tier represents a significant escalation in the alliance s efforts to monitor and respond to Russian military activities in the region."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://datosabiertos.com/open_data/2024-10-02/nato-beefs-up-awacs-patrols-over-romania-black-sea-to-monitor-russian-military-activity/">
