  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s fast-changing world, open data and transparency are more important than ever. Having access to information helps people create a better future and encourages openness and democracy.
In Ghana, President Nana Akufo-Addo believes public information is a national resource. On the International Day for Universal Access to Information, he asked public officials to share information more openly. He talked about Ghana&rsquo;s progress in digitizing public services and creating open data platforms. He also said more work is needed for full transparency and accessibility. The Right to Information Act in Ghana helps with transparency, according to the Minister of Information, Ms. Fatimatu Abubakar. UNESCO&rsquo;s Tawfik Jelassi also mentioned that access to information is a basic right.
Internationally, NATO shows transparency in its defense operations. They use AWACS aircraft to watch Russian military actions and protect Romanian airspace. These planes, based in Greece and Germany, give important information about air battles. This is a new level of openness for NATO during peacetime. It responds to Russian drones entering Romanian airspace, likely aiming at Ukraine. This shows the need for open access to important information for global security.
In the U.S., the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) in Asheville, NC, is dealing with the effects of Hurricane Helene. The storm caused power and internet outages, blocking access to NOAA&rsquo;s temperature data. This led to frustrating 404 errors or &ldquo;access denied&rdquo; messages for users. Efforts to fix these issues are ongoing, and patience is needed as recovery continues. This situation shows the need for reliable systems to share important data, even during natural disasters.
Understanding open data is key for transparency, accountability, and progress. When information is easy to access, people can make better decisions, leading to a brighter future. Public trust is important for the success of these efforts. When people see the value of open data, they are more likely to support and use it.
For example, in the U.S., the open data movement grew with the start of Data.gov in 2009. This site aimed to give public access to important datasets from the Federal Government. Over time, more people have understood and used this data, leading to greater engagement.
In the UK, the government started the Open Data Institute (ODI) in 2012 to promote open data. The ODI&rsquo;s work to educate the public has increased trust and participation in open data efforts.
Knowing about open data is important for creating a culture of transparency and accountability. By understanding its benefits and challenges, people can help build a more informed and empowered society.

    <br/> The National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is experiencing difficulties in delivering temperature datasets and other data from their National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) in Asheville, NC, due to recent severe weather events caused by Hurricane Helene. The hurricane, which made landfall on September 27th, caused significant damage to the Asheville area, including washed-out roadways, impassable areas, and the loss of critical infrastructure such as power, internet, and cell service. These disruptions are hindering NOAA s ability to move data from on-premises to the cloud, resulting in  404  or  access denied  error messages for users trying to access the data.  An administrator from NOAA s Open Data Dissemination (NODD) office, Program Manager Patrick Keown, acknowledges the inconvenience caused by the situation and assures users to be patient while NOAA works to restore the necessary infrastructure for data delivery. Once power and internet services are restored, NOAA will focus on restoring their data feeds.  In summary, the recent impact of Hurricane Helene on Asheville, NC has disrupted NOAA s ability to deliver data to the cloud, causing access issues for users. NOAA is working to restore the damaged infrastructure and data feeds, and users are advised to wait for the restoration process to be completed.

    <br/> President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of Ghana has urged public officials to view public information as a national resource rather than personal property. He emphasized the importance of embedding access to information into public sector institutions, encouraging proactive dissemination of information. President Akufo-Addo highlighted Ghana s progress in digitizing public services and creating open data platforms, but stressed the need for continued efforts to prioritize access to information in public sector reforms.  The Minister of Information, Ms Fatimatu Abubakar, mentioned the enactment and implementation of Ghana s Right to Information Act, 2019 (Act 989), which has led to enhanced transparency and citizens  rights to request and receive information from public offices. She called for mainstreaming access to information within all public sector institutions, ensuring routine publication of key documents and fostering a culture of openness.  The Acting Director General of Communication and Information at UNESCO, Tawfik Jelassi, stressed the significance of comprehensive and free access to public information across all levels of government. He emphasized that access to information should be a fundamental right for everyone, and effective implementation of laws is crucial to achieving this goal.  In summary, President Akufo-Addo and other officials have called for a shift in mindset from secrecy to openness in governance, with a focus on making access to information a priority in public sector reforms. They highlighted the progress made in Ghana, but also acknowledged the need for continued efforts to ensure that access to information is a fundamental right for all citizens.

    <br/> NATO has deployed advanced Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, specifically the Boeing E-3A Sentry, to monitor Russian military operations and enhance Romanian airspace defense. The flights, operating from Greece and the NATO AWACS main base at Geilenkirchen, are a response to repeated violations of Romanian airspace by Russian drones. This deployment, which includes a $270 million E-3A Sentry, is a significant move as it marks a rare commitment of such a capable air reconnaissance platform to the borders of the Russo-Ukrainian War.  The AWACS aircraft, capable of detecting aircraft-sized objects at hundreds of kilometers, process various forms of intelligence, including pilot voice intercepts, ground missile launches, and radar emissions. The recent intensified monitoring of NATO s southeastern tier, as evidenced by the Dutch E-3A Sentry s flights over Romania, is unprecedented in peacetime operations.  This deployment comes after the United States Air Force ceased reconnaissance missions using Global Hawk surveillance drones over the Black Sea, a move possibly linked to a June 25 telephone conversation between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov.  In the lead-up to potential Russian missile strikes on Ukraine, Russian Air Force planners are reportedly redeploying Tu-95MS strategic bombers at Engels-2 air base, near Saratov. If a NATO AWACS were present during such an attack, its sensors would likely detect every incoming aircraft, drone, and missile.  Overall, the deployment of NATO s AWACS aircraft to Romania s eastern tier represents a significant escalation in the alliance s efforts to monitor and respond to Russian military activities in the region.

    <br/> The US embassy in India has increased visa appointments by 250,000 to accommodate the surge in demand from Indian tourists, skilled workers, and students. This move comes amid a 35% rise in Indian travelers to the US in 2024, with over 1.2 million Indians having visited so far. The US embassy reported record numbers during the student visa season, with all first-time applicants securing an appointment at one of its five consular sections across India.  Currently, around six million Indian citizens hold non-immigrant visas to visit the US, with over 140,000 study visas issued to Indian students in 2023. The US aims to expedite the visa process, a goal set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden. India has become the top source of international students in the US for the second consecutive year in 2024.  The US is also planning to send more of its students to India as the two countries strengthen their diplomatic relations. The US Department of State updates global visa wait times, with Bangladesh experiencing the longest wait times of up to 265 days as of September 2024. However, wait times at Indian embassies have decreased from 245 days in 2022 to 56 and 70 days in New Delhi and Mumbai, respectively.  These wait times are influenced by staffing at US consulates, which consider visa overstay rates and economic growth rates for different countries. In 2022, visa overstay rates for Ghana and Nigeria were 18% and 20%, respectively, compared to India s rate of 3%.  The US has also expanded its visa services in the Philippines, opening a new Visa Application Centre with an updated online appointment system on September 28. As of 2022/23, there were 3,818 students from the Philippines studying in the US.  In summary, the US embassy in India has responded to the growing demand from Indian tourists, skilled workers, and students by increasing visa appointments. The US
