  <meta name="description" content="Daily News Digest: How Open Data Changes Our World
Welcome to today’s news digest! We will talk about the latest news in open data and how it affects different parts of our lives. From money markets to new technology, and from startups to national security, open data is making big changes.
Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Rise in Digital Money
The cryptocurrency market is very active. Bitcoin has hit $65,000 because of large investments in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF alone got $184 million, adding up to almost $18 billion in total. Ethereum ETFs also got $43.2 million. With over $5.8 billion in Bitcoin options set to expire, the market is expected to be more volatile. Traders are watching key levels and discussing what might happen next at Benzinga&rsquo;s Future of Digital Assets event.
Bemi: Changing How We Manage Databases
Bemi is a startup from Canada, now in San Francisco. It is making it easier to use databases for event-driven systems. With nearly $1.2 million CAD in funding, Bemi provides an automatic audit trail for Postgres databases. This helps track data without needing many engineering resources. Bemi is focusing on healthtech, climate tech, and logistics and plans to hire more Canadian engineers. It promises a better future for medium to large businesses.
Speeding Up Home Buying with Open Property Data
Movemnt has joined the Open Property Data Association (OPDA) to make home buying faster. OPDA includes big banks like NatWest, HSBC, and Lloyds. They have created open property data standards that cut the time from mortgage offer to contract exchange to just 15 days. By asking the government to digitize property data and getting feedback from homebuyers, OPDA wants to make the home buying experience even better.
Canada&rsquo;s Fight Against False Information
Canada&rsquo;s foreign ministry is finding it harder to fight false information online because they can&rsquo;t access social media data as easily. A memo from former deputy minister Marta Morgan says the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism’s data analytics is limited by restricted access to social media APIs, especially from Facebook and Twitter. This makes it harder to protect elections and maintain Canada&rsquo;s reputation. The ministry is looking for new ways to work with social media platforms, civil society, and scholars to solve these problems.
AI and Customer Innovations in Banking
At Backbase&rsquo;s ENGAGE Asia 2024 event in Ho Chi Minh City, over 150 banking leaders met to talk about AI-driven strategies and customer-focused innovations. They launched Backbase&rsquo;s global AI Centre of Excellence and shared success stories from banks like Techcombank and EastWest Bank. The event showed how AI can improve customer engagement and efficiency, with awards given for digital excellence.
Australia’s Promise to Sustainable Technology
Australia plans to increase funding for sustainable technology for developing countries, supporting the UN Pact for the Future. This initiative focuses on open innovation and sharing scientific benefits. Professor Matthew Rimmer highlights the need to adapt technologies to local needs and protect Indigenous knowledge. Foreign Minister Penny Wong committed to replenishing the Asian Development Fund and offering Climate Resilient Debt Clauses by 2025 to help vulnerable nations and improve regional connections.
Improving Voluntary Carbon Markets
A recent speech stressed the importance of high-integrity voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) to meet climate goals. The speech noted current challenges in supply, demand, and market integrity, and highlighted efforts to fix these areas. Key points included the need for consistent data protocols, better price transparency, and efficient market structures. The Treasury Department aims to use its expertise to strengthen VCMs, believing that with better integrity and functionality, VCMs can reach their full potential.
Open data initiatives play a crucial role in driving transparency, efficiency, and innovation across various sectors. People should be aware of these practices because they help individuals, businesses, and governments make informed decisions. Public perception significantly impacts the success of open data initiatives. When people understand and trust these practices, they are more likely to support and engage with them.
For example, the Open Property Data Association (OPDA) has transformed the home buying process by reducing the time from mortgage offer to contract exchange to just 15 days. This improvement has garnered positive public perception, leading to increased adoption and further enhancements in the home buying experience. Similarly, Bemi&rsquo;s innovative approach to database management has received positive feedback from sectors like healthtech and climate tech, driving its growth and success.
In conclusion, today&rsquo;s news shows how open data is changing different parts of our lives. From money markets and new startups to national security and sustainable technology, open data continues to drive progress and innovation. As we follow these developments, it&rsquo;s clear that open data holds the key to a more transparent, efficient, and fair future.
