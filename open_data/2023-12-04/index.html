  <meta name="description" content="Oracle, a top tech company, is known for its helpful data platform in healthcare. This platform, called Oracle Health, combines information from electronic health records (EHR) and payers to give a complete view of a person&rsquo;s health. Oracle Health focuses on managing and preventing long-term conditions and gives important information to healthcare groups.
The IDC MarketScape: U.S. Value-Based Health Analytics 2023 Vendor Assessment report shows that Oracle is skilled in cloud, analytics, and AI. This puts them in a good position to make positive changes in healthcare. With many clients, Oracle also has opportunities to help even more in the healthcare field.
Open data isn&rsquo;t just for healthcare. In New York City, lawmakers might pass a law to use noise cameras. These cameras would catch cars with loud mufflers and exhaust systems. The cameras use microphones to hear loud noises and record videos of cars that are too noisy. People who break the noise limit could be fined from $800 to $2,625.
Using open data in this way aims to make life better for people by reducing noise pollution. There have been a lot of complaints about noise in New York City, so action is needed. Some people worry that the cameras might be used unfairly or in the wrong way.
Open data initiatives, like the one in New York City, want to be open and easy to use. By sharing information with the public, it lets people and groups make smart choices and hold authorities responsible. This helps communities get involved and feel more powerful.
Open data isn&rsquo;t just for one industry or problem. It can be used in many areas like healthcare, transportation, and education. Open data uses facts and numbers to give helpful insights that can make things better.
As we move forward, it&rsquo;s important to keep supporting open data and its benefits. Using open data principles makes society more honest and fair, which helps us and future generations. It makes sure our children have a better world.
