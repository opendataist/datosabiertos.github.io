  <meta name="description" content="Cloudflare and Databricks have joined forces to simplify and reduce the cost of sharing and collaborating on live data. This partnership aims to provide organizations with the fastest, most secure, and most affordable data sharing capabilities across the globe. By leveraging Databricks&#39; Delta Sharing, the industry&rsquo;s first open protocol for secure data sharing, and Cloudflare&rsquo;s zero egress, distributed object storage offering, R2, data teams can easily and efficiently share live data sets without complex transfers or duplications, and without incurring egress fees. This collaboration eliminates the complexity and dynamic costs associated with multi-cloud analytics and AI initiatives, making data sharing more accessible and transparent.
LlamaZOO has announced the beta release of its digital twin editing software, Clarity Digital Twin (ClarityDT). This software creates real-time replicas of physical assets, such as manufacturing facilities, geographies, and mines, by analyzing data from various sources. By streamlining operations through the use of 3D replicas, organizations can enhance their efficiency and decision-making processes. Acuity Brands is already leveraging ClarityDT to enhance its Atrius portfolio of cloud applications. The ClarityDT beta program allows users to start working within their digital twin using mixed reality in a matter of days, making it a powerful tool for businesses looking to optimize their operations.
ADVANZ PHARMA, a fast-growing biopharmaceutical company, has chosen to standardize its commercial operations on Veeva Commercial Cloud. By leveraging Veeva&rsquo;s software and data, ADVANZ can drive a unified field strategy and strengthen engagement with healthcare professionals. This move allows the company to increase visibility throughout the customer engagement journey and maximize impact as it expands into new markets. Veeva Commercial Cloud provides a complete picture of customers and enables precision engagement, empowering ADVANZ to sustain growth and improve patient outcomes.
Nomoko, a provider of real-world 3D data technology, has joined the Overture Maps Foundation as a Contributor member. This foundation aims to advance open and accessible map data and is supported by companies like Amazon Web Services, Meta, Microsoft, and TomTom. By collaborating with these companies, Nomoko aims to create interoperable 3D datasets and support the development of open-source tools and datasets for immersive and interactive mapping applications. Nomoko&rsquo;s state-of-the-art 3D data technology captures high-resolution imagery and precise data, enabling the creation of detailed digital environments. This collaboration will contribute to the growth of the global 3D mapping and modeling market, which is expected to reach over €6.5/$7B by 2025.
The RISING CITIES. SMART FUTURE 2023 conference will be held in Bucharest, Romania on June 21, 2023. This conference aims to explore the potential of smart cities and drive sustainable urban development. It will bring together professionals, decision-makers, and thought leaders from various fields to discuss topics such as green and smart buildings, sustainable transportation, data privacy, and citizen engagement. The conference is supported by esteemed partners committed to promoting innovation and sustainability in smart city development. Attendance is free, and registration is still open, providing an opportunity for individuals interested in the future of cities to learn and network.
Nine new space satellite data suppliers have joined the Copernicus program as &lsquo;Contributing Missions&rsquo;. These companies will provide complementary Earth observation data to address the data needs of the Copernicus Services and public authorities. This move keeps the program ahead of the game in the rapidly changing sector of observing Earth from space. The data provided by these companies will complement the information from the Sentinel missions and help monitor changing land, oceans, and atmosphere. This is a vote of confidence for European Earth Observation New Space and highlights the importance of open data in understanding and protecting our planet.
Improving the scalability of a business requires sorting administrative functions and implementing clear processes. Access to real-time data allows business owners to make informed decisions and eliminate guesswork. Implementing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, such as M1 by ECI Solutions, can streamline administrative processes and provide real-time data integration. The successful implementation of ERP software requires cultural change, involvement from management, and alignment of fragmented systems and data. This technology offers cost-effectiveness, reduced manual labor, improved decision-making, and increased productivity, making it a valuable tool for businesses looking to scale organically.
Over 6,000 projects and project ideas for rebuilding Ukraine have been registered in the state electronic ecosystem DREAM. This system allows communities to create and manage reconstruction projects, attract financial resources from international partners, and control the implementation process. The prototype for DREAM was the internal unified information system E-ROAD, which was developed in 2021 for managing road projects. The Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC 2023) will take place on June 21-22 in London, providing an opportunity for stakeholders to discuss and support the reconstruction efforts in Ukraine.
Spotnik Technologies has launched Smart City Studio Pro, a software toolkit that revolutionizes city planning, development, and management. This software allows users to create virtual models and assess different scenarios before implementing them in the real world. It focuses on sustainability and generates simulations to predict the impact of urban development projects on the environment and quality of life. Spotnik plans to make the software more customizable in the future, catering to different needs and emphasizing geolocation, mobility, visualization, and physical simulations. This tool is aimed at urban planners, architects, sustainability departments, and other professionals in the public and private sectors, providing them with a powerful tool to create smarter and more sustainable cities.
