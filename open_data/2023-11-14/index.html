  <meta name="description" content="China is working to make better use of public data by considering a way to set prices for it. Experts think that data is valuable and can be bought and sold. The price of public data should start at a fair level and can change over time. This change is expected to make a lot of money for China&rsquo;s data market in the future.
In the United States, there are more Indian students studying there than ever before. They have become the biggest group of international graduate students, surpassing China. This increase in Indian students has also helped the US economy by bringing in $7.1 billion. The number of Indian graduate students has gone up by 63%, and undergraduate students have gone up by 16%. US universities are focusing on recruiting in India because of problems with other countries like the UK and Canada.
Even though the US is the top choice for international students, there are some problems. It is hard for students to get an education, get a visa, and find work after they graduate. Unlike other countries, the US does not have a plan to recruit international students. The US needs to fix these problems and bring more international students to different parts of the country.
Human Rights Watch wants an investigation into Israel&rsquo;s attacks on medical places and people in Gaza. They say that these attacks might be war crimes. The Israeli military has been accused of attacking hospitals and hurting Gaza&rsquo;s healthcare system. The World Health Organization says that at least 521 people, including 16 medical workers, have been killed in these attacks. Israel should stop these attacks, and other countries should look into what happened.
In the world of technology, IOTech has made a new data platform called Edge Central. This platform lets organizations easily get, process, and manage industrial data without being stuck with one company. It can connect to devices and sensors, process data well, and move data to and from the cloud. Edge Central can work with different kinds of hardware, operating systems, and processors. This helps organizations use data better and reach their goals.
All of these things happening in data, education, human rights, and technology show that open data, being able to see what is happening, and being able to get to things are important. They help the economy grow, let people share knowledge, and make society better. As we deal with the challenges and chances of today, it is important to use data and information in the right way to make a better future for the next generation.
