  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of our Daily Open Data Digest. Here, we share the latest news about open data, technology, and analytics. Today, we have two important stories that show how data can help shape a better future.
First, let&rsquo;s talk about data.europa Academy&rsquo;s &lsquo;Portal&rsquo; courses. These courses are for data professionals who want to learn more about open data. The courses teach how to understand data portals and use the data effectively. Some key courses are &lsquo;Moving towards Data Spaces&rsquo; and &lsquo;Improving Open Data and Metadata Quality.&rsquo; These courses cover important topics like data sharing, sustainability, and managing high-quality data.
The academy offers different ways to learn, such as e-learnings, webinars, and reading materials. New content is added regularly, so it&rsquo;s easy to stay updated. You can follow data.europa on social media or subscribe to their newsletter. These courses are a great chance for anyone who wants to improve their skills in managing data and understanding open data.
Next, let&rsquo;s look at Oracle Corp. The company is doing very well because of big investments in its database business, cloud infrastructure, and AI technologies. Oracle reported an 8% revenue growth in the recent quarter and a 54% increase in stock value this year.
At Oracle&rsquo;s recent CloudWorld event, the company showed its multicloud strategy. This includes partnerships and a focus on security. Oracle is expanding its cloud regions and introducing new technologies like duality and HeatWave. These innovations are helping Oracle stand out from other companies. Oracle&rsquo;s use of AI and focus on important applications show its commitment to using data and technology to drive progress.
It&rsquo;s important for people to know about open data initiatives. Open data makes information available to everyone, which can lead to better decisions and more innovation. When people understand the benefits of open data, they are more likely to support these initiatives.
For example, New York City launched its open data portal in 2012. This portal provides lots of information about city life. People have reacted positively to this initiative, leading to more civic engagement and new applications that improve city services. Similarly, the European Union&rsquo;s open data portal has increased transparency and trust between citizens and the government.
By staying informed about open data and technology, we can all help create a better world. Knowledge is power, and together, we can use information to build a brighter future for everyone.
