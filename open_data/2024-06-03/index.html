  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Daily Open Data Digest! We bring you the latest news on how open data is changing our world. From improving public health to boosting financial innovation, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening today:
New York City is making big changes to improve public restroom access. This has been a long-standing issue for both residents and tourists. Mayor Eric Adams announced the &ldquo;Ur in Luck&rdquo; initiative. Over the next five years, the city will add 46 new restrooms and renovate 36 in city parks. This will improve life for parents, seniors, and vulnerable groups by promoting public health and equity.
Google Maps will now have a new layer to help people find these restrooms easily. Local advocate Teddy Siegel, who made a map of over 2,000 restroom locations, stressed the importance of accessible restrooms. The upgrades will include more stalls, better accessibility, and energy-saving features. Information on these changes will be available on Open Data, ensuring transparency and community involvement.
Veeva Systems, a company that provides cloud software for the life sciences industry, has received mixed reviews from analysts. Morgan Stanley lowered its stock price target, but other brokerages had different opinions. The company&rsquo;s stock has a moderate buy rating with a target price of $228.65, despite a recent 10.3% drop in trading.
Financially, Veeva Systems has shown positive earnings, with a market value of $28.11 billion and a P/E ratio of 51.40. Some directors have sold shares, while institutional investors and hedge funds have increased their holdings. Analysts expect a good fiscal year, with earnings per share predicted to be 4.11. Veeva Systems continues to innovate in the life sciences field, offering solutions for customer relationship management, content management, analytics, and data solutions.
The Digital Accountability and Transparency (DATA) Act of 2014 has been crucial in promoting government transparency. The act standardized data for federal spending, allowing for better oversight and public trust. Key factors in its success include bipartisan leadership, innovative implementation, and data quality audits.
Lessons from the DATA Act show the importance of agreeing on the problem, forming alliances, creating trusted teams, building external support, compromising while keeping the vision, and involving users in implementation. As technology advances, future laws will need to keep up to maintain effective governance and transparency.
Rodrigo Silva, EVP at Temenos, talks about the big opportunities in serving small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the US banking industry. Research shows that SMEs want more comprehensive financial services from their main banks, presenting a great revenue opportunity for banks.
Open banking and cloud technology offer ways for banks to meet SME needs, compete with fintechs, and use AI for personalized services. Investing in technology to serve SMEs can lead to more revenue, customer trust, and market competitiveness. The SME sector is a fertile ground for innovation and growth.
Today&rsquo;s stories highlight the power of open data and technology in improving public services, driving financial innovation, and promoting transparency. As we continue to use data, we move closer to creating a fairer, more informed, and connected world. Stay tuned for more updates on how open data is shaping our future.
