  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Open Data Digest! Here, we talk about how open data changes our world. From digital twins to economic surveys, and from smart strategies to saving the environment, open data helps us innovate and move forward. Let&rsquo;s look at the latest news.
Digital twins are virtual copies of real-world systems. They improve many areas at a low cost. But, they can be tricky because of complex data and different standards. Experts say to start with small projects and focus on specific places. Using AI and keeping data accurate are key. By working carefully and together, businesses can get the most out of digital twins.
Strider Technologies, a company that offers smart strategies, has opened a new office in Tokyo. This will help with economic security and state-sponsored risks. Strider uses open-source data to help big companies, universities, and governments in Japan. They will show their skills at ECONOSEC Japan 2024.
The Economic Survey 2023-24 shows fewer people are unemployed and more people are working. But, some worry the data might not be reliable because of government changes. The Modi Government says it has created jobs, but other sources like CMIE disagree. This difference shows we need better data to understand the true job situation in India.
Buildings cause 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers at Notre Dame made a tool to check the carbon in buildings. They found fixing old buildings is better than building new ones. Making buildings last longer and smaller can cut carbon emissions a lot. Their study in Chicago gives useful data for city planning. This helps cities cut carbon and keep old buildings. The benefits are good for the environment, society, and culture.
The United States and Latvia have agreed to work together on science and open data. They both see the importance of research and tech for economic growth and trade.
In Maricopa County, some conservative activists want to watch ballot drop boxes to build voter trust. They use open-source data to find illegal voters. But, state officials worry this might scare voters. The debate over watching polling places is heating up as the election nears. A court ruling talked about balancing election safety and free speech. Democrats are worried about a GOP plan to have more poll watchers, fearing it might scare voters.
Open data is important for our world. It helps with new tech and makes governments clear. As we see these changes, we need to solve problems and use data to make a better future. Stay tuned for more news in our next edition of the Daily Open Data Digest.
Thank you for joining us today. Let&rsquo;s keep supporting open data and work for a brighter tomorrow.
