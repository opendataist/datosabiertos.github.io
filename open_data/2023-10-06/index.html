  <meta name="title" content="Using Open Data to Drive Positive Change: From Carbon Emissions to Good Governance"/>
  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, we have some exciting updates on the use of open data to improve various aspects of our lives. From reducing carbon emissions to promoting good governance and enhancing digital service delivery, open data is proving to be a powerful tool for positive change.
Firstly, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is taking a significant step towards greater transparency and environmental responsibility by expanding its CO2 Connect emissions calculator. By adding more airlines and airline groups as data contributors, the tool will become even more accurate and reliable. This means that passengers and stakeholders can make more informed choices when it comes to compensating for their carbon footprint. The use of actual operational data from around 150 airlines sets this calculator apart from others that rely on theoretical models. It&rsquo;s a great example of how open data can be used to drive sustainability in the aviation industry.
Moving on to Zimbabwe, the country has set an ambitious goal to achieve upper middle-income status by 2030. To accomplish this, they will need to ensure good governance, attract investment, and promote economic transformation. Transparency in government processes, effective management of public finances, and accountability in decision-making are crucial factors in achieving these goals. By leveraging open data and promoting a business-friendly environment, Zimbabwe can attract both foreign and domestic investment, leading to sustainable economic growth.
In Ireland, the public sector is facing challenges in delivering efficient and user-friendly digital services. Many websites and apps are functional but lack a cohesive user experience. This is where design thinking comes into play. By putting the user at the center of the thought process, the public sector can create digital services that are not only functional but also easy to use. Estonia serves as an excellent example of a country that has successfully implemented a user-centric digital strategy. Overcoming resistance to change and adopting a user-centric approach are key to improving digital service delivery in the public sector.
On the law enforcement front, the Portland Police East Precinct in the United States recently conducted a successful Stolen Vehicle Operation (SVO). This operation resulted in numerous arrests, the recovery of stolen vehicles, and the dismantling of a Tesla theft ring. By leveraging data and collaboration between different units, law enforcement agencies can effectively combat car theft and improve public safety.
Lastly, the IATA is making further strides in promoting transparency and accountability in the aviation industry. By signing agreements with several airlines, the organization is improving the quality and accuracy of its CO2 Connect emissions calculator. This tool uses actual airline data to provide accurate per passenger CO2 emissions calculations. With the addition of new data contributors, the calculator now receives operational data from around 150 airlines, representing 98% of the global passenger fleet. This ensures that customers have access to accurate and consistent CO2 emissions data, empowering them to make more sustainable travel choices.
In conclusion, open data is playing a crucial role in driving positive change across various sectors. From reducing carbon emissions to promoting good governance and enhancing digital service delivery, the power of data is undeniable. By leveraging open data, we can create a more transparent, accessible, and sustainable world for future generations.
