  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Open Data Digest! Here, we share the latest news about open data, digital infrastructure, and new technology. Today, we will talk about new data centers, government plans, cool software, and financial news.
Open DC Sdn Bhd has big news. They are building a new data center in Kedah, Malaysia, which will open by early 2025. This center will use less energy and rely on renewable sources for 80% of its power. This will help reduce pollution and make Malaysia an important place for digital investments. Open DC is working with DE-CIX Malaysia to improve internet connections. This new center will join their other centers in Cyberjaya, Penang, and Johor.
In Scotland, the Digital Directorate is working to make public data more valuable. Martin Macfie, the Head of Open Data, says they need a smart plan to use open data better. The government wants to fit this plan into its larger digital strategy. They aim to work together for a long time and set high standards for data publication. They plan to improve the statistics.gov.scot website and work on other digital projects. This will make open data useful for everyone and help improve public services.
On the financial side, Veeva Systems (NYSE: VEEV) got a buy rating from Needham &amp; Company LLC, with a target price of $260.00. The stock opened at $216.44, with a low of $162.72 and a high of $236.90 over the past year. Veeva Systems, known for its cloud software for the life sciences industry, did very well last quarter. Big investors own 88.20% of the stock, showing strong market confidence in the company.
In Australia, the mortgage industry is changing with the launch of Salestrekker 2.0. Created by Dalibor Ivkovic and his team, this new platform helps brokers and lenders with new tools. Features like Salestrekker Premium, Bundle, Spark, and Lightning make loan processing easier with automation. Salestrekker 2.0 also covers commercial, personal, and asset finance. It will use Open Banking data to give better insights into lender policies and help brokers generate more business.
Understanding open data is important for many reasons. Open data makes things transparent and accountable. It helps citizens make informed decisions and trust public institutions. For businesses, open data can lead to growth and efficiency. However, it also raises concerns about privacy and data security.
Public perception is key to the success of open data initiatives. When people trust that their data will be used responsibly, they are more likely to support these initiatives. Negative perceptions can slow down the adoption of open data practices.
Take the UK&rsquo;s National Health Service (NHS) as an example. The NHS has made healthcare data accessible to the public, leading to advances in medical research and better patient care. However, concerns about data privacy have also come up, affecting public trust. By addressing these concerns openly, the NHS has managed to keep public support.
Another example is the City of New York. Their open data policies have changed how residents interact with their city. By sharing data on public transport and crime, the city has empowered its citizens. This transparency has built trust and collaboration between the government and residents.
Today&rsquo;s updates show big steps in open data and digital infrastructure. From eco-friendly data centers to smart government plans and cool software, these developments show the power of data in making the world better. Stay tuned for more updates as we explore the exciting world of open data and its impact.
Thank you for joining us in today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Open Data Digest. Let&rsquo;s use the power of information to create a brighter future for everyone!
