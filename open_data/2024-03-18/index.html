Africa doesn&rsquo;t have enough electricity, so people are talking about using renewable energy sources to meet the growing need. The Renewable Power Plant Database Africa says that renewable energy like hydropower, solar, and wind could give 76% of the continent&rsquo;s electricity by 2040. Experts say sharing data and experiences across borders is important for successful renewable energy development.
Secretary Blinken spoke at the Summit for Democracy in Seoul about the importance of democracy in helping people worldwide.
