  <meta name="description" content="India is becoming stronger economically, but this has attracted foreign powers who want to hinder its progress. The recent controversy involving TMC MP Mahua Moitra has brought attention to the issue of &ldquo;cash for questions&rdquo; in parliamentary democracies. It has been revealed that NGOs, some of which are funded by foreign sources, often meet with government officials to discuss issues, and politicians may seek outside help to ask questions. This raises concerns about the lobbying system in India and the potential for foreign interference.
Attacks on Indian institutions, like the Adani group, are part of a bigger plan to undermine trust in democratic institutions. These attacks aim to create doubt and instability, which weakens the country&rsquo;s progress. It is important for India to trust its institutions and strengthen its systems to fight against foreign interference and support Indian businesses.
One way to strengthen these systems is through open data. Open data means that certain information should be freely available to everyone to use and share as they want, without any restrictions. By making data more accessible and transparent, open data encourages collaboration and sharing of knowledge.
Open data can help combat foreign interference by providing accurate and reliable information. It allows for analyzing statistics and generating insights that can help with decision-making. By making data openly available, India can ensure that its institutions are accountable and that the public has the information they need to make informed choices.
Transparency and access to information are important for a functioning democracy. Open data empowers citizens by giving them the tools they need to hold their government accountable. It also encourages collaboration between the government, civil society, and the private sector, which leads to more effective policies and programs.
In conclusion, India needs to be careful of foreign interference and work on strengthening its institutions. Open data can play a crucial role in this process by promoting transparency, collaboration, and sharing of knowledge. By embracing open data, India can ensure that its progress is not undermined and that it creates a better future for the next generations.
