  <meta name="description" content="Today&rsquo;s news brings some exciting updates about open data. Let&rsquo;s get started!
First, let&rsquo;s talk about some interesting facts from Malaysia&rsquo;s real estate market. In the third quarter of 2023, the value of transactions went up by 22.6% compared to the same time last year. The most popular type of property was terraced housing, and affordable housing dominated the market. It&rsquo;s good to see that housing prices have stabilized with small increases.
Now, let&rsquo;s move on to the UK. The government is taking steps to make the fuel market more transparent. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will monitor and report on road fuel prices. Fuel retailers, including supermarkets, will have to show their prices and profits. This is happening because a CMA report found that some supermarkets were not giving the savings to consumers. This information will help make sure there is fair competition and prevent prices from going up for no reason.
In the world of technology, Microsoft, Google, and Onehouse are working together on the OneTable project. This project aims to make it easier to access and convert data across different platforms. It will create a new layer on top of data lake table formats. This is a solution to the problem of choosing a table format and being stuck with one company. It&rsquo;s exciting to see these big companies working together to make data more open and accessible.
Now let&rsquo;s talk about South Africa. The wholesale telecoms market is expected to grow a lot. The wholesale fixed access market is projected to grow by 9.1% every year until 2027. It will make more money than mobile facilities. This growth is because of the open access model. Fiber network operators can focus on building the infrastructure while internet service providers handle sales and customer support. The report also talks about the potential for growth in the mobile virtual network operator industry and the impact of high-capacity cables on the market.
Lastly, let&rsquo;s look at Finland&rsquo;s social and healthcare system. This article gives an overview of the government laws, partnerships between the public and private sectors, health ecosystems, and innovative healthtech startups. It also talks about the challenges faced by health IT systems because of COVID-19 and the opportunities in the global digital health market. It also talks about how healthcare reimbursement is affected by hierarchical condition categories and the relationship between policy and public health. The Affordable Care Act is an important law in the healthcare industry.
That&rsquo;s all for today&rsquo;s news on open data. Stay informed and keep exploring the world of data, information, and knowledge for a better future!
