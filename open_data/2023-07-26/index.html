  <meta name="description" content="Today&rsquo;s news digest brings you the latest updates on open data and its impact on various sectors. Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) are gaining attention in the public sector as organizations like the Open Data Institute (ODI) promote their use. PETs enable greater access to data while maintaining privacy and security. These technologies have the potential to be used in public services, such as healthcare and tax fraud detection. Efforts are being made to raise awareness and support the adoption of PETs in the public sector, despite challenges such as the need for technical expertise and the perception that PETs are a luxury.
In the realm of climate change, Saudi Aramco is taking significant steps to reduce emissions and address environmental concerns. The company is developing solutions such as lower-carbon hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and geothermal energy. With a goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, Aramco is partnering with technology leaders to implement innovative approaches. Projects include a lower-carbon hydrogen demonstration plant, a carbon capture test unit, and a CO2 sequestration solution using in situ mineralization. The company is also exploring the expansion of its renewable energy portfolio through geothermal energy.
Moving to Africa, the data center market in the region is experiencing rapid growth. It is expected to reach a value of $4.92 billion by 2028, with South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya emerging as key players. Egypt is also attracting significant attention from investors. The demand for advanced IT infrastructure, including high-speed switches and flash storage devices, is driving this growth. Additionally, sustainability is becoming a key focus, with a push for eco-friendly alternatives. The development of special economic zones, public-private partnerships, and governmental support for digitalization are further driving the expansion of data centers in Africa.
In the world of mapping technology, the Overture Maps Foundation (OMF) has released its first open dataset, potentially disrupting the dominance of mapping giants like Apple Maps and Google Maps. The dataset includes information on over 59 million places, roadways, and administrative boundaries. The goal is to offer free access to an interoperable mapping API, which could be used in various applications such as autonomous driving vehicles, logistics, education, gaming, and the metaverse. While it remains to be seen if this effort will challenge the established mapping apps, it could lead to increased competition and ultimately benefit consumers.
In conclusion, open data continues to make waves across various sectors. Privacy enhancing technologies are being promoted in the public sector, with the potential to improve services while maintaining privacy and security. Saudi Aramco is taking significant steps to reduce emissions and address climate change through innovative solutions. The data center market in Africa is experiencing rapid growth, driven by the demand for advanced IT infrastructure and a focus on sustainability. Lastly, the release of an open dataset by the Overture Maps Foundation could disrupt the mapping industry and lead to increased competition. These developments highlight the importance of open data, transparency, and accessibility in shaping a better future.
