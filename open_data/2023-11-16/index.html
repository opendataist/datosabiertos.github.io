  <meta name="description" content="MIT recently gave out the MIT Prize for Open Data to 10 research projects that use and share open data. The prize is for researchers who help with the open data movement by creating ways to share data, studying open data, or using open data in their work. The winners were picked from over 80 people and were honored at an event called Open Data @ MIT. The projects are about many different things, like getting organs, studying the brain, studying tiny things in the ocean, making it easier to publish data, studying politics, studying planets, studying language, operating satellites, studying kids, and studying the tech industry. The MIT Libraries website has a list of all the winners and other projects that did well in the competition.
There is a new software called GING that makes it easier to share packaging data with other companies in the supply chain. GING is built around the Open 3P data standard. It lets people store and share packaging data in a safe and easy way. The goal of GING is to make data better and easier to use for companies in the packaging industry. It also helps them follow the rules about data. GING makes it so people don&rsquo;t have to move data around themselves. It also works with other software that companies are already using. People who work for GING watch over the data and make sure it is safe and follows the rules.
A company called Privacera won an award for its Unified Data Security Platform at the 13th Annual Globee Business Awards. The platform helps people find and protect sensitive data. It also helps people use the data in a way that follows the rules. Privacera works with big companies and is known for its work on privacy, security, and following the rules. The CEO of Privacera said they were thankful for the award and want to keep working on data security and following the rules.
A project in Kenya helped make the county of Wajir better prepared for disasters caused by the weather. The project asked people in the community to make maps of their area. The maps showed things like buildings, roads, and other important things. This helped the community know what could be affected by a disaster. The project had meetings with leaders from the county and people from the community to talk about how to do the project and work together. The meetings talked about what people were worried about and who would do what to make the project work.
A report about open data says that researchers still don&rsquo;t have enough help to share their data with others. The report says that researchers need to work together more and have better tools to share data. Some researchers get help from people they work with, but most have trouble sharing their data. The report also says that researchers don&rsquo;t get enough credit for sharing their data. The report found that researchers know about tools to help with data, but they don&rsquo;t always use them.
A company in Mongolia called APU is using a platform called Boomi to make its business better. APU wants to sell its drinks in more countries around the world. Boomi helps APU by connecting different systems, making it easier to use the cloud, bringing data together, and making it easier to work with other companies. Boomi has helped APU make an open data system. This lets APU work with the government, banks, and customers for things like following the rules, getting paid, and buying things. Using Boomi has made APU&rsquo;s business better by making it easier to see what is happening, selling things faster, and making less technical mistakes.
In the end, the new things happening with open data show how important it is to share knowledge, make data easier to get, and make sure data is safe and follows the rules. These things, like giving awards to researchers, making new ways to share data, and helping communities, make society more open and informed. As more people want to use open data, it is important to help researchers and give them tools to make science and new ideas better.
