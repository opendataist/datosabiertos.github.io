  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Open Data Digest! Here, we share the latest news on how open data makes the world better. From saving the environment to new tech and public health, open data helps create a brighter future.
The European Molecular Biology Laboratory&rsquo;s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) is a leader in open data for biodiversity and climate change. Their databases, like the Biodiversity Portal and the AlphaFold Database, are great tools for scientists. These resources help study genes, microbes, proteins, and more. This research helps us understand species, ecosystems, and how they change over time. With this knowledge, we can find ways to protect our planet and fight climate change.
In the shipping world, the SOBC-1 is a 200-meter ship exploring green solutions. SINTEF shares open data on its design, which helps estimate fuel use and speed. Researchers can use this data to study eco-friendly shipping, like wind power and new fuels. The data includes models and test results, with more updates coming soon. This project helps develop sustainable shipping tech.
Dublin City Council, Google’s Project Air View, and Smart Dublin have shared air quality data collected over 16 months. They used an electric Street View car to measure six pollutants. The data is now on Google’s Environmental Insights Explorer and Smart Dublin’s platform. This project aims to raise awareness and improve Dublin&rsquo;s air quality. A hackathon from February 24-26 will explore this data further, showing how citizens and tech can tackle environmental problems.
Global Solutions Ventures (GSV) is looking for qualified people for the Prosecutor Vetting Commission Secretariat in Moldova. The Investigator-Analyst will do research and background checks on candidates, analyze data, and support the Commission. Applicants need a relevant degree, data analysis experience, and proficiency in Romanian and English. They cannot have worked in the Moldovan prosecution system. Applications, including a CV, cover letter, references, and a background check consent form, are due by 18:00 on September 27, 2024.
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) reported $263.1 million in cannabis tax revenue for Q2 2024. This includes $154.3 million in excise tax and $108.8 million in sales tax. Q1 2024 revenue was revised to $266.4 million. Since January 2018, total cannabis tax revenue has reached nearly $6.3 billion. The vendor compensation program lets eligible retailers keep 20% of excise tax due, running through Dec. 31, 2025. More details are on the CDTFA website.
Open data drives innovation and positive change in many fields. It helps us understand biodiversity, fight climate change, develop green shipping, and improve urban air quality. By staying informed and engaged, we can all help create a better world.
Thank you for joining us in today&rsquo;s Open Data Digest. Stay tuned for more updates on how open data shapes our world for the better.
