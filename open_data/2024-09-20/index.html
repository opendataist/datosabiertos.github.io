  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Open Data Digest! Here, we look at the latest news about open data and how it affects our communities and innovations. From healthcare and safety to technology and politics, open data is changing our world in big ways. Here are today&rsquo;s top stories:
In Katsina State, Nigeria, the WorldPop team and the African Field Epidemiology Network are on a mission to find unvaccinated children. They go door-to-door to give vaccines. They didn&rsquo;t have accurate maps, so they used lower-quality satellite images and Google&rsquo;s AI model. Cloudy weather and small buildings made it hard, but this shows how important good maps are for helping people, especially in emergencies.
Alibaba Cloud has introduced &ldquo;CUBE DC 5.0&rdquo; at the Apsara conference. This new data center design promises better AI performance and faster setup times. It includes a new cooling system and better power distribution, cutting setup times by 50%. Alibaba also showed new AI models like Qwen 2.5, which supports 29 languages, and a text-to-video AI model, Tongyi Wanxiang. They also launched &ldquo;Open Lake data utility&rdquo; for big data and &ldquo;DMS: OneMeta&#43;OneOps&rdquo; for managing data.
Wearable devices like smartwatches and smart glasses are collecting more personal data, raising privacy concerns. Even though 72% of Americans want stricter rules, data privacy is still complex. Experts say personal data includes more than we think, like what’s in the background of video calls. Federal laws help, but teamwork between schools and companies is key to managing and protecting this data. This data can be very useful for research, not just marketing.
In Baton Rouge, the owner of Coffee Bean Cafe was shot during an attempted robbery, showing a rise in local crime. Police are looking at surveillance footage. Crime stats show more robberies and attempted murders in the area, worrying residents who are used to a safer neighborhood. This event shows the need for accurate crime data and community involvement in solving safety issues.
The Hindu Data Team used Night-Time Light (NTL) data to study voting patterns in Haryana before the October 2024 Assembly elections. This new method uses light data to measure economic activity. The study found more urban voters near Delhi and highlighted the BJP&rsquo;s rural vote share. This approach gives a better understanding of voter behavior than traditional methods.
The Cleveland Police Accountability Team and police leaders shared progress in their latest report. The city improved in areas like Community Engagement, Crisis Intervention, and Transparency, thanks to a new open data portal and better training. But more work is needed in Community Policing, Bias-Free Policing, and Use of Force. Partnerships with the mayor’s office and city council were key to these improvements, showing how open data can build trust and accountability.
Davidson Capital Management Inc. has increased its investment in Veeva Systems Inc., a cloud software provider for the life sciences industry. With a market value of $34.72 billion and a P/E ratio of 63.25, Veeva Systems is important in data solutions for healthcare. Their products, like Veeva Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault, show the growing need for data management in life sciences.
As we navigate our data-rich world, these stories show how open data can improve health, boost technology, protect privacy, and ensure safety and transparency. Stay tuned for more updates in our next edition of the Daily Open Data Digest.
Together, we can use the power of data to create a better world for future generations.
