  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Daily Open Data Digest! Here, we share the latest news and facts from the world of open data. Our goal is to keep you informed and empowered. Today, we&rsquo;ll talk about new research, climate forecasting, technology, and more.
The open science movement is changing how researchers work, especially in ethnography. Sharing data can be hard because researchers need to keep participant information private. Projects like Life in a New Language show how to share data while being ethical. This helps build a strong research community.
This year, awards for scientific excellence were given to researchers from top schools like the University of Johannesburg and the University of Pretoria. Winners studied many topics, like indigenous plants, biochemistry, aerospace engineering, and astronomy. These awards show how important open data is for research and innovation.
NIWA&rsquo;s Seasonal Climate Outlook (SCO) has grown from a simple flyer to a high-tech online service. It uses advanced technology and global data models. The SCO gives key information on temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, and river flows. This helps sectors like agriculture, energy, and health plan better. Future updates might include weather apps powered by AI for more accurate and easy-to-use forecasts.
Apple and Google have teamed up for the Data Transfer Project. They made a tool to transfer photos between Google Photos and iCloud Photos easily. This tool makes it simple to move photos without downloading them first. Instructions are available on both companies&#39; support pages.
ASICS is starting a new project to protect athletes from online bullying. They are working with Signify to offer AI-driven cybersecurity services to athletes during big events. This is part of ASICS&#39; &lsquo;Mind and Body Athlete Support Programme,&rsquo; which focuses on both physical and mental health. Athletes like Eilish McColgan appreciate this support.
The NRF&rsquo;s uLwazi Node of the NRF-SAEON won the NSTF-South32 Data for Research Award for its Open Data Platform. This platform gives valuable environmental data for research and public use. It helps scientific and technological advancements in South Africa. The award shows the importance of making research data accessible and well-managed.
People in the telecommunications industry have concerns about the Federal Government&rsquo;s plan to lay 90,000 kilometers of fiber optic cables. Issues like Right of Way charges, multiple taxes, and informal fees need to be fixed for the project to succeed. State governments, private companies, and World Bank funding are important for building broadband infrastructure.
Celebrating 25 years of issuing Seasonal Climate Outlooks, NIWA has moved from manual methods to using supercomputers. The SCO gives important weather predictions based on climate events like El Niño and La Niña. Better communication through social media has made these forecasts more accessible, helping sectors like agriculture, energy, and health. The future could bring personalized weather prediction apps using AI and global data.
Open data helps us understand our world better. It supports research, climate forecasting, technology, and athlete wellbeing. Stay tuned for more updates and continue to be part of this journey towards a better, more informed future.
Thank you for joining us in today&rsquo;s Daily Open Data Digest. Together, we can make a difference.
