  <meta name="description" content="Investigators from Bellingcat and the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN) are using open source methods to hold Russian soldiers and military leaders accountable for war crimes committed in Ukraine. By utilizing social media posts and videos, these investigators are changing the way war crimes are documented and the structure of the legal system.

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has signed six pieces of legislation during his first year in office, but only three of them were part of his administration&rsquo;s priority bills. Congress may not be unified in supporting the president&rsquo;s priorities, as members may prioritize their own interests. The House of Representatives and the Senate have expressed support for Marcos&#39; priority measures, but the Senate may provide more resistance and scrutiny compared to the House. Marcos has certified three bills as urgent, including the controversial Maharlika Investment Fund Act, but critics argue that the constitutional mechanism of certifying bills as urgent has been misused. Measures supporting local agriculture, health investment, and the National Land Use Act should be the focus of the Marcos administration.

Various CBDC initiatives are already underway in the APEC region, and the US is now actively participating in the interoperability proposal.
In conclusion, open data is being utilized in various fields to bring about positive change. From holding war criminals accountable to improving supply chain transparency, open data is enabling progress and driving innovation. It is important to continue advocating for open data and ensuring its accessibility and transparency for the betterment of society.
