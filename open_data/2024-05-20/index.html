  <meta name="description" content="Forestry England is working in four forests to help nature thrive by giving it space to grow on its own. They are expanding native woodland, bringing back lost wildlife, and creating open habitats for more biodiversity. This helps with flood control and storing carbon. They also share data and work together to support these efforts.
Forestry England is trying new things and keeping an eye on how things are going. They look at data and work with experts to make sure they are helping the climate, producing timber in a sustainable way, and bringing back biodiversity. The goal is to make environments richer in nature for both people and the earth.
In Nigeria, using AI to estimate food prices has been helpful in understanding how prices change and what that means for food security. By getting prices from the public and comparing them to AI estimates, they can get a good idea of what prices are like in real time. This shows why having clear and free data is important for accurate market analysis.
VantageScore has come out with a new credit model called VantageScore 4plus that uses both open banking data and traditional credit data. This will change how loans are given out. It helps lenders take less risk and gives credit to people who couldn&rsquo;t get it before, like new immigrants or those with little credit history. The model can also spot financial trouble early, which is key in uncertain times, and more lenders are using it for better credit checks and more access to financial help.
These projects show how sharing data, being clear, and working together can make a better world for the future. By using technology, trying new things, and sharing data, groups can make environments that are more sustainable, strong, and full of nature, which helps both people and the earth.
