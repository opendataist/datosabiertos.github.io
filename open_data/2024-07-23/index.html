Mastercard has started new business cards in Uzbekistan. These cards help small and medium businesses (SMEs) with their work. The cards allow for many types of payments, both inside the country and abroad, using different currencies. This helps people understand and use money better.
Mastercard teamed up with Uzbek Uzum Media to create learning materials and courses. These tools teach people about money matters, making it safer and easier to use digital payments. This teamwork ensures everyone can handle the digital economy safely.
We can already see the good results. More people are using Mastercard payment cards in Uzbekistan. In 2023, there were 225,942 cards issued. This shows that more people are using digital payments, which are faster and clearer.
Open data is important because it makes information available to everyone. By giving SMEs the tools and knowledge they need, Mastercard and its partners are helping to create a clear and fair financial system in Uzbekistan.
People should know about these efforts because they help everyone make smart choices. When people understand the benefits of knowing about money and being clear, they are more likely to support these efforts.
For example, in Estonia, the government shares a lot of information with the public. This has made people trust the government more and get involved. They can see how money is spent and how services work, which makes everything clear and fair. This has led to more people using digital services.
In Uzbekistan, similar efforts can make people more informed and involved. By supporting financial learning and clarity, we can help build a better future for everyone.
