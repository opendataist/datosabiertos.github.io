In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, clear information is very important. Recently, Russia stopped a big drone attack from Ukraine. They shot down 158 drones in different places, including Moscow. Most of these drones were stopped near the Ukrainian border. Earlier, Russian drones attacked Ukraine&rsquo;s energy systems. Over 66,000 Russian soldiers have died in the war. It is hard to track these deaths, especially for conscripts who became professional soldiers without telling their families. Open data helps document these deaths and understand the war&rsquo;s real impact.
Amazon is working to save water because its data centers use a lot of it. By 2030, Amazon wants to save or replace more water than it uses. They say they are water-efficient, but experts think they do not count the water used by power plants that supply their centers. Amazon is teaming up with water tech startups and funding water-saving projects worldwide. This shows how important it is for companies to be open about their environmental actions.
Veeva Systems, a company that makes cloud software for the life sciences industry, has had its target price raised to $251 by Robert W. Baird. They have an &ldquo;outperform&rdquo; rating. Veeva reported strong earnings and more investment from institutions. They offer solutions for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, like customer relationship management, content management, analytics, and data solutions.

The EarthCare.ai project, started by Jovanovski and Dragan Gelevski, aims to reverse the damage caused by the climate crisis. The project builds on the success of AirCare, which made air quality data accessible. With extreme weather events worsened by global warming, actionable climate data is crucial for businesses to reduce risks and costs. Jovanovski&rsquo;s background in software engineering shows the importance of clear and open climate data in tackling these challenges.
Today&rsquo;s news shows how open data is crucial in many areas, from war documentation and environmental conservation to life sciences, digital transformation, and climate action. Transparency, access, and availability of information are key to creating a better world for future generations. Stay informed and engaged as we continue to explore the power of open data in shaping our world.
