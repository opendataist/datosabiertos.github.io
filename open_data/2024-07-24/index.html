  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of our Daily News Digest! Today, we will talk about the latest news in open data and how it can change our world. If you care about making the world better for future generations, you&rsquo;ll find today&rsquo;s stories interesting. They show how open data can drive innovation, sustainability, and job opportunities.
The Overture Maps Foundation is here to challenge Google in the mapping world. Big tech companies like Meta, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and TomTom are backing this effort. They want to create open map databases that anyone can use. The Linux Foundation supports this project and invites other businesses to help make accurate and up-to-date maps.
These new maps will help many things, like IoT devices, self-driving cars, logistics apps, and even the metaverse. By making it easier to use map data from different sources, the foundation hopes to speed up the creation of new mapping products. The first datasets will be released in 2023, with more improvements to come. This project will provide valuable information that can help advance technology and improve our daily lives.
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) is working hard in Uzbekistan. They have projects to boost the economy and protect the environment, especially in the textiles and garments sectors. These projects help diversify the economy, improve market access, and make manufacturing companies more productive and better at exporting.
One special project is turning industrial zones into Eco-Industrial Parks. This aims to improve environmental, economic, and social performance for a sustainable future. With a budget of $3 million, including $872,564 for 2024, UNIDO’s efforts will have a lasting impact on the region’s economy and environment. These projects show the importance of using data to drive sustainable development and create a better world for future generations.
In today’s fast-changing job market, AI skills are becoming very valuable. Employers may offer up to 47% higher salaries for those skilled in AI. You don’t need a computer science degree to start. Free courses on AI basics and programming languages like Python are available online. You can also specialize with courses like the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng and get hands-on experience on platforms like Kaggle.
Building projects to show on GitHub and networking with AI professionals on LinkedIn and online forums can boost your career. By getting certifications, specializing, gaining experience, and networking, you can become the AI expert at your job and possibly earn a higher salary. This is a great chance to use data and intelligence to secure a better future for yourself and your family.
Today&rsquo;s stories highlight the power of open data in many areas. From creating accurate maps to driving sustainable development and enhancing job opportunities, open data is paving the way for a better world. By staying informed and embracing these innovations, we can all help create a brighter future for future generations.
