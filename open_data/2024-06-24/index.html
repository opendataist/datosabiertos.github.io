  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s news digest! We will explore the latest in open data and how it is changing different fields. From health studies to new tech, here’s what’s happening today.
A new study shows that living a healthy life, even at age 80, can help you live to 100. People aged 80 and older who exercise, practice mindfulness, keep balanced, and stay active are more likely to reach 100. Good nutrition, enough sleep, and social activities also help. Experts say that making healthy lifestyle choices can lead to longer, disease-free lives.
In a big legal case about tenant rights, the Simply Better Homes Tenants Association is fighting against Simply Better Apartment Homes (SBAH). The real estate group is accused of wrongful evictions and turning rent-stabilized apartments into market-rate ones. With help from Brooklyn Eviction Defense, tenants are seeking justice. This case shows the need for strong advocacy and legal help to protect vulnerable people.
Researchers at the Max Delbrück Center have created the Open-ST platform. This new tool helps study tissue samples in great detail. It can show how cells interact in diseases like cancer. By rebuilding tissues in 3D, Open-ST can find complex disease mechanisms and possible treatments. It is affordable and flexible, making advanced science tools more accessible and speeding up discoveries in many fields.
PhD student Nabil Panchi has improved autonomous navigation in the Arctic. His algorithm, part of the DigitalSeaIce project, clears images of fog and rain. This helps AI better analyze sea ice surroundings, making Arctic voyages safer. As global warming increases Arctic shipping, this innovation is crucial. Panchi and his supervisor Ekaterina Kim also created the SeaIceWeather dataset, offering valuable open-access resources for weather-resilient tech.
Baybars Örsek is a leader in fact-checking. He started Turkey&rsquo;s first political fact-checking project and open data platform. Örsek is a trusted expert for global media. His work at the Poynter Institute and the International Fact-Checking Network, and his role at TESEV, shows his commitment to media transparency and accuracy.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has launched the AgriTech Observatory. This new tool tracks digital agriculture in Europe and Central Asia. It has interactive filters, a map, and analytics to explore initiatives and data. The Observatory helps address regional challenges and promotes innovation. Its goal is to drive digital transformation in agriculture, encouraging collaboration and filling data gaps.
Today&rsquo;s stories show the power of open data in health, housing, science, and agriculture. With detailed information, we can make better decisions for a brighter future. Stay tuned for more updates on how open data shapes our lives and drives positive change.
