  <meta name="description" content="St. Helens Council Cyber Attack Highlights Ongoing Threat to Public Sector
St. Helens Council recently fell victim to a cyber attack, shedding light on the ongoing threat faced by the public sector. The council&rsquo;s failure to pass a Cyber Essentials test in the past two years has been confirmed by the Electoral Commission. Ransomware is identified as a major cyber threat, particularly in the health and social care sector. To address these challenges, the Resilience and Cyber4Good 2023 conference will take place online next week, featuring sessions on building cyber resiliency in the health and public sectors. The conference aims to provide valuable insights on strengthening cyber defenses and will include speakers from various public bodies.
City Council Meeting in Austin to Address Open Policing Data Release and Other Key Issues
The upcoming City Council meeting in Austin promises to be interesting and fun, with a range of important topics on the agenda. Notable items include a resolution for open policing data release, addressing windowless living spaces and embracing tiny homes, creating a zoning category for music venues and creative spaces, opposing a plan to dam the South Llano River, considering economic incentives for NXP Semiconductors, approving an EMS contract, and adopting an updated plan for developing the airport. The Austin Monitor, a nonprofit news organization, relies on community donations to provide in-depth reporting.
Supreme Court of India Supports National Judicial Data Grid for Transparency and Accountability
The Supreme Court of India has announced its support for the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), a platform that provides real-time data on the pendency of cases. The Chief Justice of India, DY Chandrachud, stated that the NJDG will bring transparency and accountability to the judicial system. The portal, developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and the Supreme Court&rsquo;s in-house team, allows users to access information on case pendency, types, and year-wise breakdowns. The NJDG is seen as a significant innovation under the government&rsquo;s ease of doing business initiative.
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Seeks Information Management Officers
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is seeking two Information Management Officers for its Regional Office for Southern &amp; Eastern Africa in Nairobi, Kenya. The officers will be responsible for coordinating information management activities, managing web content, analyzing data, supporting assessment and needs analysis, and developing and maintaining spatial datasets. The ideal candidates should have a master&rsquo;s degree in archival, information science, information systems, social science, or a related field, along with at least five years of experience in information management or a related area. Fluency in English is required, and knowledge of French is desirable.
San Francisco Police Officer Investigated for Allegedly Altering Race Data
A San Francisco police officer is being investigated for allegedly altering race data of people he stopped. This incident has raised concerns about the credibility of the officer and the potential systemic issue within the department. The San Francisco Public Defender&rsquo;s Office and the Department of Police Accountability are both worried about the accuracy of data and its impact on addressing race disparities within the department. The police commission plans to discuss the issue in a future meeting and develop an action plan.
African Development Bank and Government of Korea Sign Agreements to Support Africa&rsquo;s Development Agenda
The African Development Bank and the Government of Korea have signed two agreements worth $28.6 million to support Africa&rsquo;s development agenda. The funding will primarily focus on energy access, agricultural transformation, and knowledge and capacity-building in African countries. The agreements were signed during the 7th Korea-Africa Economic Cooperation Ministerial Conference in Busan. The funding will be disbursed in three installments over the next three years. The second agreement aims to strengthen statistical cooperation and enhance the capacity of African countries to produce quality data.
UK Government&rsquo;s Department for Science, Innovation and Technology Funds Open Network Solutions
The UK Government&rsquo;s Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) has announced the names of 19 projects that will receive funding to support the development of open network solutions, such as 4G and 5G based OpenRAN. The projects aim to develop software and hardware products that promote the adoption of open and interoperable technologies for digital networks. The projects will initiate trials of open 5G networks in various locations across the UK, including major urban centers, sports and entertainment venues, and seaside resorts. The funding is part of the UK&rsquo;s Open Networks Research and Development Fund.
Trivedi Centre for Political Data Faces Controversy Over Departure of Psephologist
Members of the scientific board of the Trivedi Centre for Political Data (TCPD) have accused Ashoka University of forcing out psephologist and professor Gilles Verniers without informing the board. The TCPD, under Verniers&#39; leadership, has been instrumental in providing open-access data and conducting analysis of India&rsquo;s elections. The board members expressed regret over Verniers&#39; departure and the lack of communication from the university regarding decisions that impact the future of TCPD. They highlighted the significant contributions of TCPD, including the production of groundbreaking datasets and research projects, and its role as a primary source for scholarship and commentary on Indian politics. In response, the board members dissolved the TCPD&rsquo;s scientific board and pledged to support Verniers&#39; efforts to maintain the integrity of the data and associated work. Ashoka University stated that Verniers did not clear the university&rsquo;s tenure process and chose to leave.
Uniphore Launches AI-Powered Metadata Solution for Enterprise Data
Conversational AI company Uniphore has launched U-Capture, an AI-powered metadata solution for data collected across the enterprise. U-Capture collects data from call center conversations or other business audio or video records and applies automation and connected applications to understand and reformat the content for analysis and coaching. The tool also uses emotion AI to tailor its suggestions and coaching based on sentiment. Uniphore acquired voice recording firm Red Box to solve the problem of unstructured call center data. U-Capture is available in multiple regions worldwide.
Pakistan&rsquo;s Economic Challenges Can Be Addressed Through Sustainable Practices
Pakistan&rsquo;s economy has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including the covid-19 pandemic, inflation, energy shortages, and fiscal deficits. To ensure a resilient and sustainable future, Pakistan should focus on sustainable manufacturing, modern agriculture, the chemical industry, energy storage, and bio refineries. By adopting innovative approaches in these sectors, Pakistan can address its economic issues and lay the foundation for a more prosperous economy. Examples from developed countries demonstrate the transformative power of sustainable practices. With the right policies and investments, Pakistan can overcome its challenges and move towards a sustainable future.
Barriers to Open Science Implementation and Efforts to Promote Data Sharing
Despite the growing awareness of the benefits of open science, there are still barriers to its implementation in many disciplines. These barriers include a lack of understanding of how to conceptualize work in terms of data, hesitancy in sharing data due to legal or ethical concerns, and a low barrier to re-collecting certain types of data. The Research Data Alliance (RDA) is actively working to address these barriers by engaging with different disciplines, providing training sessions, and developing guidelines for data sharing. RDA domain ambassadors and data champions play a crucial role in advancing open science and ensuring the adoption of FAIR data sharing. Efforts are also being made to improve recognition and reward for data sharing within the academic career model. The RDA is launching a project called RDA TIGER to provide support and services to working groups within the alliance. Overall, the key to promoting data sharing is to make it easy with the right tools and infrastructure.
