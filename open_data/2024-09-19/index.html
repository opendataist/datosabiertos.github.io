  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Open Data Digest! Here, we talk about the latest news in open data, datasets, and analytics. Today, we have exciting news from Australia and the United States. These new projects could change AI development and how we understand the universe.
In Australia, the Kangaroo LLM project is starting a big web crawling task. On September 25th, the &ldquo;Kangaroo Bot&rdquo; will start collecting data from 754,000 Australian websites. This data will create the VegeMighty dataset. The goal is to capture Australian English and culture, making sure the AI model understands local context.
The project focuses on ethical data collection, transparency, and data sovereignty. All data processing will happen in Australia. Website owners can opt out using robots.txt files. Supported by leaders like HPE, this project makes Australia a leader in ethical AI development.
In the United States, two new AI institutes funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Simons Foundation will help us understand the universe better. Each institute will get $20 million over the next five years to create advanced astronomical tools using AI.
The NSF-Simons AI Institute for Cosmic Origins, led by the University of Texas at Austin, will work on large datasets and simulations to learn more about the cosmos. The NSF-Simons AI Institute for the Sky, led by Northwestern University, will solve complex astrophysical problems.
Both institutes aim to make data access easier, help researchers, and provide AI training and education. They will also offer outreach activities and online courses to inspire future scientists and enthusiasts. This ensures that the benefits of their work are shared widely.
These projects show how open data can drive innovation and discovery. By using large datasets and advanced analytics, we can find new insights and solutions that help society.
People should know about these projects because they promote transparency, ethical standards, and inclusivity. Understanding open data and its uses can help people make informed decisions and contribute to societal progress.
Public perception is crucial for the success of open data projects. When people understand and trust these practices, they are more likely to support and join them. For example, the Kangaroo LLM project&rsquo;s focus on ethical data collection and transparency can build public trust and encourage more website owners to share their data.
Case studies show how perceptions are influenced. In the United States, the NSF-Simons AI institutes&#39; commitment to making data accessible and providing education has received positive public perception. This support has led to more participation in their programs and a bigger impact on the scientific community.
Stay tuned for more updates on these exciting developments and how they continue to shape our world. Together, we can ensure a brighter, more informed future for all.
Thank you for joining us in today&rsquo;s Daily Open Data Digest. Until next time, keep exploring the endless possibilities of open data!
