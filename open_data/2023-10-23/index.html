  <meta name="description" content="The city of New York is taking a proactive approach to tackle the issue of rat activity by using open data. They have created a rat map and an app called Transit to gather information on rat sightings. Transit, which helps commuters find the best way to their destination, has recently launched a feature called the NYC Subway Rat Detector. This feature tells users how busy a subway station is in terms of recorded rat activity. Users can also report rat levels at a station through an in-app questionnaire, providing real-time insights to the app&rsquo;s 1.2 million New York users and transit agency partners.
In other news, Global Affairs Canada has detected a campaign connected to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. The campaign, known as &ldquo;Spamouflage,&rdquo; involved a bot network leaving thousands of comments on the social media accounts of Canadian Members of Parliament. The goal of the campaign was likely to discredit and denigrate the targeted MPs and silence criticism of the Chinese Communist Party. Global Affairs Canada has taken action to remove the activity and will continue to monitor the information environment for threats against democracy.
Meanwhile, the Canadian government introduced the Tech Talent Strategy to attract workers and entrepreneurs to the country&rsquo;s tech sector. As part of this strategy, improvements were made to the Start-Up Visa program, which helps foreign entrepreneurs gain permanent residence in Canada. However, there are concerns that the program has not been successful in creating jobs, promoting innovation, or attracting foreign investment. A thorough evaluation of the program is recommended to measure its performance and set achievable targets.
The World University Service of Canada (WUSC) is seeking a Monitoring, Evaluation, Research, and Learning (MERL) Officer for their NBS West Africa Project. The officer will be responsible for monitoring and evaluating nature-based solutions (NBS) in Ghana, Guinea, and Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire. They will contribute to the development and implementation of the MERL plan, provide technical support to project staff, and ensure the collection and management of reliable data.
Lastly, Peak XV&rsquo;s startup scale-up program, Surge, has launched its ninth cohort, which includes Australian companies for the first time. The cohort consists of 13 startups targeting global markets, with a focus on AI and deep tech innovation. Surge provides capital and mentorship to early-stage founders through a 16-week program.
These news stories highlight the importance of open data, transparency, and accessible information in various sectors. From tackling rat activity in New York City to monitoring threats against democracy, open data plays a crucial role in informing decision-making and improving outcomes. Whether it&rsquo;s attracting talent to the tech sector or evaluating the effectiveness of programs, data and information are essential for driving progress and creating a better future.
