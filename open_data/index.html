      <h2>&#34;How Open Data is Revolutionizing Business, Warfare, and Digital Governance&#34;</h2>
      <p>Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of our Daily News Digest. Today, we will talk about open data and how it changes different areas. Open data helps make things clear and helps people make smart choices. Here are the main stories today:</p>
<p>Veeva Systems, a top company that makes cloud software for the life sciences industry, has updated its Q3 earnings forecast. The company now expects earnings per share (EPS) of $1.57-1.58 and revenue between $682-685 million. Analysts have mixed opinions on the stock, with a consensus price target of $230.13. The stock has ranged from $162.72 to $236.90 in the past year. Veeva Systems had strong earnings last quarter, beating expectations. Senior executives are selling stocks, which adds complexity to the company&rsquo;s finances.</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine has caused many deaths, with over 66,000 Russian soldiers reported dead. This number has gone up by more than 4,600 in the last four weeks. Open-source info and satellite images show the high human cost of the conflict. The casualties include conscripts and prisoners, with Bashkortostan having the highest number of deaths. Russian President Putin claims nearly 700,000 soldiers are involved, but the official Russian defense ministry says 5,937 deaths. Ukrainian President Zelensky reports 31,000 Ukrainian soldier deaths in the first two years of the war.</p>
<p>Reliance Jio has offered 100GB of free cloud storage in India, challenging Google One and iCloud. This is part of a bigger plan to collect user data for AI models and reduce reliance on foreign services. Indian tech companies like Ola are also making moves. Ola switched from Azure to its Krutrim Cloud and offers discounts on Ola Maps. This competition has led to price cuts by Google Maps and more discounts by Ola Maps for developers, helping consumers and encouraging innovation.</p>
<p>Vietnam is making big steps in digital transformation, especially in administrative tasks and public services. Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính stresses the need for strong digitalization, aiming for no paperwork, no cash, and no unnecessary contact by 2025. Goals include decentralization, resource allocation, transparency, and investment in digital infrastructure. Progress is seen in better public service centers, digital hubs, and improved data sharing. Vietnam&rsquo;s online public services and open data rankings have improved, showing increased public satisfaction and the country&rsquo;s commitment to a digital future.</p>
<p>Open data continues to shape our world, from corporate transparency and military accountability to tech advancements and digital governance. People should know about these initiatives because they help make informed decisions and foster transparency. Public perception greatly affects the success of open data initiatives. When citizens trust the data from their government, they are more likely to engage in civic activities and support public policies.</p>
<p>Consider Estonia, known for its digital governance. Estonia&rsquo;s open data initiatives have led to high public trust and engagement, resulting in a more transparent and efficient government. In contrast, in countries where public perception of open data is negative, the impact of such initiatives decreases, leading to lower engagement and trust.</p>
<p>By understanding open data, its benefits, and downsides, people can better appreciate its role in modern society. Open data empowers citizens, fosters innovation, and drives progress in various sectors. As we navigate these complex landscapes, the power of open data remains a beacon of knowledge, helping us make informed decisions and strive for a better future.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us in today&rsquo;s Daily News Digest. Stay informed, stay empowered, and let&rsquo;s continue to use the power of open data for a brighter tomorrow.</p>
