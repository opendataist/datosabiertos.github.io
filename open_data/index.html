      <h2>**Latest Trends in Energy, Technology, and Data Regulation: A Comprehensive Update**</h2>
      <p><strong>Open Data Digest: Helping You Make Smart Choices for a Better Tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to today&rsquo;s Open Data Digest! Here, we talk about the latest news in open data. This helps you understand the facts and figures that shape our world. Whether it&rsquo;s about energy, technology, or data rules, we&rsquo;ve got you covered.</p>
<p><strong>Big Changes in the UK&rsquo;s Energy</strong></p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s energy scene is changing a lot. In 2022, the UK made 14% of the energy in OECD Europe and used 10% of it. Even though energy production has been going down, new oil fields like Rosebank are being developed. The UK is also keeping its nuclear power plants running longer and building big hydrogen plants. The UK is moving away from Russian energy and focusing on renewable sources. This means less natural gas production and more imports. Coal is also being used less, with efforts to use geothermal energy. Now, the UK&rsquo;s renewable energy is more than its fossil fuels, which is a big step towards a green future.</p>
<p><strong>Menlo Park&rsquo;s New GIS Hub</strong></p>
<p>Menlo Park has started a new GIS Hub. This gives people access to different GIS datasets like zoning maps, safe biking paths, and police citations. GIS analyst Patrick Palmer and manager Whit Loy led this project to make public data easy to access. The city is also using GIS tech for future projects, like the Vision Zero dashboard to make streets safer. The ACT Menlo Park app lets people report non-emergency issues, helping with long-term planning. This makes it easier for the community to make smart choices.</p>
<p><strong>The US Needs Better Data Rules</strong></p>
<p>The US is behind other G-7 countries in data rules. Countries like the UK, Australia, and Germany have strong data protection laws. The US lacks a federal data protection law. Data rules make sure AI systems are accurate and trustworthy. Only 42% of countries have good AI rules, with richer countries doing better. While most countries ask the public for input on data rules, they often do not respond.</p>
<p><strong>Squirrels and Ecosystems</strong></p>
<p>Squirrels are important for ecosystems. They spread seeds and serve as prey. Researchers at the University of Alaska Fairbanks used AI and citizen science to map squirrel populations worldwide. This helps with biodiversity conservation. The study uses machine learning and big data, made possible by cloud computing. Researchers believe AI is key to understanding complex ecosystems, not just squirrels.</p>
<p><strong>Formstack Buys Open Raven</strong></p>
<p>Formstack, a top software provider, has bought Open Raven to boost data security. Open Raven&rsquo;s platform helps with cloud data visibility and compliance. This aims to give customers better data control and automation. Formstack&rsquo;s CEO says data security is crucial for productivity. The buyout will offer more data features, AI use, and automated workflows. Formstack is trusted by over 32,000 organizations and offers data capture, document generation, eSignature, and Salesforce form solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Veeva Systems' Stock Update</strong></p>
<p>Veeva Systems offers cloud software for the life sciences industry. Wall Street analysts have different ratings for its stock, with an average target price of $227.95. Truist Financial recently lowered its target price to $197.00. The stock opened at $179.75 on Friday, with a market cap of $29.06 billion. There have been significant stock sales by insiders, and institutional investors have changed their positions in VEEV.</p>
<p><strong>Data Recovery for Mac Users</strong></p>
<p>Mac users can use Time Machine for backups and data recovery apps like EaseUS, Stellar, Disk Drill, and TestDisk. Professional services are available for hardware-damaged drives. Backups are very important to prevent data loss.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Communications' New Data Promo</strong></p>
<p>Smart Communications, Inc. has a new Magic Apps promo. It offers NO-EXPIRY data for popular apps starting at PHP 99 for 3 GB. You can also get 9 GB and 36 GB options. This promo is great for those who want value, bulk data, long-lasting usage, and frequent travelers. Stay connected with Smart&rsquo;s Magic Apps and enjoy their top-notch network coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Data Transparency and Wealth</strong></p>
<p>Richer countries often have better data transparency, but not always. Low-income countries like Rwanda can be more transparent than richer ones like Iceland. Factors like data literacy, press freedom, and strong statistical institutions affect data access. Even countries with high transparency scores can lack true transparency. For example, Russia&rsquo;s press freedom is declining. Social statistics are less accessible than economic or environmental data, affecting public health responses. Laws like the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act in the US aim to improve data transparency.</p>
<p>Stay informed with the latest in open data. Together, we can make better choices for a brighter future.</p>
