      <h2>UK Government Launches Pumpwatch Scheme to Help Drivers Save Money on Fuel</h2>
      <p>UK Government Launches Pumpwatch Scheme to Help Drivers Save Money on Fuel</p>
<p>The UK government has a new plan called Pumpwatch to make the fuel industry more fair. Fuel stations will have to show the prices of their fuel within 30 minutes of changing them. This will let drivers compare prices and find cheaper options, which could save them up to 3p per litre.</p>
<p>The Pumpwatch scheme lets drivers see fuel prices on different platforms like mobile apps and websites. This makes it easy for drivers to find the cheapest fuel and decide where to fill up.</p>
<p>People who sell fuel and experts in the industry support the plan. They think it will make prices fairer and create more competition. In Australia, a similar plan helped drivers save about £48 each year.</p>
<p>Türkiye to Use AI Chatbot for Public and Military Institutions</p>
<p>Türkiye is getting its own chatbot called &ldquo;MAIN.&rdquo; This chatbot is made by a company called Havelsan and is for public and military institutions. It will focus on keeping data safe. At first, the chatbot will only be available on special hardware from Havelsan.</p>
<p>The MAIN chatbot will be ready on February 1. After that, they will see what people need and want from it. It will start by helping with text and writing, but later it will also work with images and sounds. This chatbot can help public and military institutions communicate better and work more efficiently.</p>
<p>Veeva Systems Gets Higher Price Target After Good Earnings</p>
<p>Veeva Systems is a company that makes software for the life sciences industry. They recently made more money than people expected. Because of this, the Royal Bank of Canada has raised the price target for Veeva Systems from $225.00 to $250.00. The company&rsquo;s stock has been doing well, with the highest price in the past year being $225.49.</p>
<p>Experts think Veeva Systems will keep doing well and most of them say to buy their stock. Big investors are also changing their positions, which shows they have faith in the company. Veeva Systems keeps making new and helpful things for the life sciences industry, like software to manage customers, content, and data.</p>
<p>Former Harvard President Faces Criticism for Copying and Misusing Data</p>
<p>Claudine Gay used to be the president of Harvard University, but she had to quit because she was caught copying other people&rsquo;s work. Now, she is getting more criticism for using data wrongly in her academic work. A scientist from Denmark found problems with the numbers in Gay&rsquo;s thesis and article. The scientist also thinks the people who checked her work didn&rsquo;t do a good job. They say Gay might not understand the subject well, which is why she copied and used the data wrong.</p>
<p>People are also mad because Gay won&rsquo;t show the original data she used. This makes them think her research might not be honest. This situation shows why it&rsquo;s important to have rules about sharing data. It helps make research honest and fair. The scientist also thinks there might be unfairness based on race and gender in schools. They say everyone should have the same chances to learn and get information.</p>
<p>In conclusion, today&rsquo;s news shows how important it is to have open data and be honest. The UK government&rsquo;s Pumpwatch scheme helps drivers by showing them real-time fuel prices, so they can make good choices and save money. Türkiye&rsquo;s new chatbot for public and military institutions shows how technology can make communication and work better. Veeva Systems' good earnings and higher price target mean they are doing well and making helpful things for the life sciences industry. Finally, the criticism of Claudine Gay reminds us that we need rules about sharing data and being honest in research.</p>
