  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Open Data Digest! Here, we share the latest news about how open data is changing our world. From better public transit to amazing space research, open data is making our world more open and easy to understand.
Bengaluru is working to improve its public transit system. The Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) have shared their real-time transit data for a new start-up challenge. This project, supported by Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India (MBRDI) and the World Resources Institute (WRI) India, aims to create new Mobility as a Service (MaaS) apps. By sharing transit data, Bengaluru hopes to make public transportation better and easier for everyone.
The Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) package is a big collection of data for space medicine and biology. It was released on June 11, 2024. Over 100 institutions from 25 countries worked together on this project. The Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) team and the Ames Space Biosciences Division played a big role. By making this data free and open, the SOMA package helps promote teamwork and research in space biology.
Databricks has made Unity Catalog, a tool for data and AI governance, open-source. This means anyone can use and improve it. Unity Catalog helps manage data for over 10,000 organizations. It supports many data formats and compute engines, making it flexible and easy to use. By promoting open standards, Databricks shows the importance of transparency in data and AI.
The municipal bond market is using different data sources to improve financial transparency. Key data providers like the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, Merritt Research Services, and DPCData offer detailed financial information. With AI technology, analyzing this data is now faster and easier. This open data approach helps create better investment models, making the financial market more transparent.
Today&rsquo;s stories show how powerful open data can be. From better public transportation in Bengaluru to advancing space medicine, and improving data governance and financial transparency, open data is making information more open and shareable. By promoting openness and teamwork, we can create a better world for the future.
Stay tuned for more updates on how open data is changing our world. Together, we can use information to drive positive change and build a brighter future.
