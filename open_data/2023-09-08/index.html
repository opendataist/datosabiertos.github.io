  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, copyright activists are taking aim at pirated books used to train generative artificial intelligence technology. The Danish anti-piracy group, The Rights Alliance, is working to remove the Books3 dataset, which has sparked a conflict between creatives and Big Tech companies. The tension between artists&#39; rights and AI innovation is at the center of this issue.
Moving on to another important topic, the President&rsquo;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) has released a report to President Joe Biden on patient safety. The report highlights that patient safety is an urgent national public health issue. Shockingly, Medicare patients experience adverse events in one out of four hospitalizations, with one third of those events being serious. This is a concerning statistic that needs to be addressed.
The PCAST report also emphasizes that adverse outcomes disproportionately affect marginalized groups. This is a stark reminder that healthcare disparities exist and need to be addressed. The report includes four recommendations to improve patient safety, such as establishing federal leadership for patient safety and ensuring patients receive evidence-based practices. These recommendations aim to address healthcare disparities and accelerate research and deployment of safe care practices.
Shifting gears, let&rsquo;s talk about open data and its impact on our daily lives. Open data refers to information that is freely available for anyone to access, use, and share. It promotes transparency and allows for greater accountability. Open data can be found in various forms, such as statistics, records, and datasets.
One example of open data in action is the city of Ottawa&rsquo;s &lsquo;Open Ottawa&rsquo; portal. This portal provides access to various datasets, including data on red light cameras in the city. According to the data from the portal, King Edward Avenue in Ottawa continues to be a red light district, with three red light cameras on the road issuing thousands of tickets to drivers running red lights. This information is valuable for both the city and its residents, as it helps identify areas that need improvement in terms of traffic safety.
Open data not only benefits governments and organizations but also individuals. It allows us to make informed decisions and empowers us to hold those in power accountable. Accessible information is key to creating a more transparent and equitable society.
In conclusion, today&rsquo;s news highlights the ongoing conflict between copyright activists and AI innovation, the urgent need to improve patient safety, and the importance of open data in promoting transparency and accountability. As middle-aged women concerned about leaving a better world for our children, it is crucial for us to stay informed and engaged with these issues. By advocating for open data and supporting initiatives that prioritize patient safety, we can contribute to a more transparent and equitable society.
