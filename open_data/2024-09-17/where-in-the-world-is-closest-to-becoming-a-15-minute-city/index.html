    <p> A global analysis reveals that cities like Paris and Milan are close to achieving the  15-minute city  urban planning goal, where residents can access essential services within a quarter-hour walk or bike ride. However, the study highlights disparities within cities, with wealthier inner areas often having better access to services compared to urban sprawls. The concept gained popularity during the Covid pandemic, with some cities like Paris and Barcelona performing well due to their historical design before the advent of cars.  The researchers, led by Matteo Bruno, emphasize that population density is a key factor in achieving the 15-minute city, as it facilitates easier access to services. Smaller yet densely populated cities tend to score higher on the map. However, larger cities like Atlanta, Los Angeles, and several Chinese cities struggle to meet the criteria.  The study also addresses misconceptions about the 15-minute city concept, such as the false claim that it restricts movement. The researchers clarify that the idea is not about confinement but rather about creating more pedestrian-friendly areas.  Despite the growing interest in the concept, the researchers acknowledge that there are no one-size-fits-all solutions for cities. They stress the importance of considering cultural differences, such as the prevalence of apartments in Europe versus single-family homes in the United States.  The study s findings have been met with criticism from conspiracy theorists, who falsely associate the 15-minute city with restrictive policies. The researchers, including Carlos Moreno, a prominent advocate for the concept, emphasize that the idea is not about confinement but rather about creating more livable and sustainable urban environments.  In conclusion, the study highlights the progress made by some cities in achieving the 15-minute city goal, while also acknowledging the challenges faced by others. The researchers stress the need for a holistic approach to urban planning, which includes addressing inequality, improving public transport, and reducing traffic. Ultimately, the 15-minute city concept is just one element in creating a better and more sustainable urban environment.</p>
