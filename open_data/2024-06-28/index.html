  <meta name="description" content="Open Data: Building a Better Future
Today, open data is very important. It helps in many areas like economic planning, public safety, and protecting the environment. On June 29th, we celebrate Statistics Day to honor Professor Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis. This day reminds us how important good data is for our future. This year’s theme is &ldquo;Use of Data for Decision-Making.&rdquo; It highlights the need for good statistics from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and the importance of understanding these statistics for the growth of society.
Data affects many sectors. For example, the World Bank updated its income classifications in 2022. This showed economic growth and changes in population data. Countries like Guyana and American Samoa moved to high-income status. This shows how our global economy changes and why accurate data is important.
In public safety, two students from Merivale High School, Rohan Bahl and Matthew Zhou, used open data to create the &ldquo;Traffic Helper&rdquo; app. This app helps reduce accidents in Ottawa by finding safe routes for driving, walking, or cycling. In 2023, Ottawa had nearly 19,300 collisions and 27 deaths. The app gives useful information about risk, time, and distance, helping users make safer travel choices.
The tech industry also grows thanks to data. The Lenfest Institute gave $50,000 to Technical.ly for detailed reports on local IT and tech policy in US cities. They focus on how the upcoming presidential election will use AI, cybersecurity, and federal funding. This project shows how cities use data to track progress and how tech investments affect communities.
In Thailand, Gulf Edge and Google Cloud teamed up to offer secure cloud services. This partnership helps industries like healthcare, public safety, and energy by providing AI and analytics in a safe environment. Such partnerships are key for digital growth and keeping data secure.
Data also helps protect the environment. At Ventosa Vineyards, people talked about new laws in New York to protect the Finger Lakes. They focused on the Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring and Prevention Act to protect Owasco Lake from harmful algae. Good data and transparency are needed to improve water quality and get state funding for environmental groups.
The data management industry is very active. Companies like Databricks Inc. and Snowflake Inc. are leading the way. Databricks bought Tabular Technologies Inc., and Snowflake made its Polaris Catalog open-source. These moves help improve AI and analytics. Using open standards makes data management easier and ensures accurate insights for AI.
Refrigeration changed the food industry. Almost three-quarters of American food is kept cold. This changed our food system, diets, and tastes. The US leads in refrigerated space, which has allowed for the creation of dishes like the cheeseburger.
Open data is a powerful tool for a better future. By using data, we can make smart decisions, improve public safety, grow the economy, protect the environment, and transform industries. Embracing open data leads to a brighter and more sustainable future.
