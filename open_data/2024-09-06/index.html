Welcome to today&rsquo;s Daily News Digest! We will explore how open data is changing different areas of our lives. Our goal is to give you useful information to help you understand how data is shaping our world. Let&rsquo;s look at today&rsquo;s top stories.
Veeva Systems: Leading Innovation in Life Sciences
Veeva Systems is a top software company in the drug industry. They had strong results in the second quarter of 2025. Known for their smart products in Development Cloud, Commercial Cloud, and Data Cloud, Veeva has shown steady growth for ten years. Their success comes from their wide reach and good customer relationships. Even with competition, Veeva&rsquo;s strong money performance and constant new ideas make them a good choice for long-term investors.
Recently, Veeva launched the Veeva Vault CRM Service Center for life sciences companies in the Asia-Pacific region. This new service helps improve customer interactions and smooth out operations by combining sales, marketing, and customer service on the Vault Platform. With plans to move CRM for new and old customers, Veeva keeps focusing on new ideas and customer success. Insights from Veeva&rsquo;s APAC Commercial Summits show the importance of connected software and data in doing well in business.
Portland Police Bureau: Growing Drone Program for Safety
The Portland Police Bureau finished a test project for drones with success. This led to an approved plan to grow the program. The City Council used existing funds to make law enforcement more efficient and safe. During the test phase, drones recorded crash scenes and helped during tactical events. The plan to expand, which follows Oregon state law, includes more uses for drones and focuses on being open, responsible, and following strict rules to keep the public safe and private.
Madhya Pradesh: Aiming for Tech Growth
Madhya Pradesh is making progress in science and technology, especially in farming and healthcare. However, they still face problems like low investment in research and limited access to technology. The state aims for steady economic growth using scientific principles and new technologies. Madhya Pradesh ranked 13th in the India Innovation Index 2021 and sees room to improve in areas like human skills, new ideas, investment, and creating a state-specific science and tech ecosystem. Programs like the &ldquo;State Innovation Fund&rdquo; and support for research are expected to boost the state&rsquo;s economy and help India reach its $5 trillion economy goal.
Barrow in Cumbria: Fighting Crime with Data
Barrow in Cumbria has high crime rates, especially in areas like Hindpool. The police are using data-driven plans like Clear Build Hold to fight crime and help the community. Violence and sexual offenses are the most common crimes in Barrow. Efforts are being made to reduce future crimes. CrimeRate, a platform that collects data from Police UK, gives useful statistics and trends to raise public awareness and help prevent crime. Barrow is currently the 85th most dangerous medium-sized town in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
OADC Texaf Digital - Kinshasa: Opening the First Tier-III Data Centre in DRC
In a big step for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), OADC Texaf Digital - Kinshasa has opened the first Tier-III certified data center in the country. This facility supports a digital ecosystem for various internet services, focusing on colocation, connectivity, and peering options. Powered by sustainable hydro-generated electricity, the data center is key for the DRC&rsquo;s digital and ICT growth. With over 12 carriers already connected, the facility will boost the DRC&rsquo;s economy by providing a strong interconnection platform for different sectors. This partnership between OADC and TEXAD aims to drive digital change and economic growth in the region.
Today&rsquo;s stories show how open data and new technologies are changing industries and communities worldwide. From Veeva Systems&#39; progress in life sciences to the Portland Police Bureau&rsquo;s expanded drone program, and from Madhya Pradesh&rsquo;s tech goals to Barrow&rsquo;s data-driven crime prevention plans, the power of data is clear. Also, the opening of the first Tier-III data center in the DRC highlights the importance of digital infrastructure in boosting economic growth. As we keep using open data, we can look forward to a future where information and insights lead to a better world for everyone.
