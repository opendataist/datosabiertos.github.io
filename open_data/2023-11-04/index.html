  <meta name="description" content="Lots of people are driving too fast in school zones in New York City. This year, the city has given out millions of fines to drivers who go more than 10 miles per hour over the speed limit. The fines add up to hundreds of millions of dollars. Some people think the city is just trying to make money from these fines. But the city says the cameras are there to keep people safe. The Department of Transportation says that since they started using the cameras all the time, the number of violations has gone down by 30% and the number of traffic deaths has gone down by 25%.
In other news, a company called HBK Sorce Advisory LLC has sold a lot of its shares in Veeva Systems Inc. The company now owns 2,735 shares of Veeva Systems, which are worth $541,000. Other big investors have also made changes to their shares in the company. Right now, Veeva Systems&#39; shares are being sold for $194.62. In the past year, the lowest price was $157.00 and the highest price was $225.49. Veeva Systems recently reported that it made $1.21 for each share in the last quarter, which is more than what people expected. Analysts think that for the whole year, Veeva Systems will make $2.73 for each share.
These news stories show how important data and information are in our society. The speed camera fines in New York City are a good example of how data can help keep people safe. By collecting and studying data about traffic violations, the city has been able to find out where the problems are and do things to stop them. This shows that data is powerful and can help us make good choices to make our communities safer.
The changes in the shares and prices of Veeva Systems also show how data is important in money markets. Big investors use data to decide what to do with their money. The earnings per share that Veeva Systems reported tell us how well the company is doing and what might happen in the future.
In the end, these news stories show why it&rsquo;s important for us to have open data and be able to see what&rsquo;s going on.
