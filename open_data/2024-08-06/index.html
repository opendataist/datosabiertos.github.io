  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Open Data Digest! Here, we share the latest news about open data, technology, and innovation. Our stories today show how data and technology can make services better, improve security, and solve big global problems.
In Finland, a new project used big language models to sort customer feedback in Central Finland&rsquo;s wellbeing services county. The project sorted over 4,900 feedback entries into different categories and tones. This shows how AI can quickly analyze feedback. This means faster service improvements and better use of resources. It also makes the customer experience better and more transparent. The project shows how AI can help manage feedback, aiming to ensure residents are happy and get quick responses to their concerns.
Cleveland has a new Chief Innovation and Technology Officer (CITO), Stephanie Wernet. She follows Froilan Roy C. Fernando. Wernet has a strong background in IT and has worked in both private and public sectors. She will lead digital transformation and improve city services. Wernet will manage important departments like Urban Analytics and Innovation. She will also handle the city&rsquo;s open data portal and 311 services. Her skills in leading IT changes match Mayor Justin M. Bibb&rsquo;s vision of using technology to improve services and make data-driven decisions.
Swiss data science and AI company Knime has received $30 million in funding from Invus, bringing their total to $50 million. Led by CEO Michael Berthold, Knime plans to improve its enterprise AI governance and ModelOps capabilities. The company offers an open-source platform for data science and AI. It supports workflow automation, teamwork, and sharing insights. With big revenue growth and a global team of 250 employees, Knime serves major clients like ASML, Audi, and Novartis, showing its impact on the industry.
Mitie has won a £6 million contract with South Western Railway to provide security services across their network. This ensures the safety of 220,000 daily passengers. Mitie&rsquo;s Security Officers will do wellness checks on trains and use a digital incident reporting system for real-time information. Analysts will give threat updates to improve security measures. This partnership shows a commitment to innovative solutions and a safer environment for passengers, highlighting Mitie&rsquo;s leadership in facilities transformation and strong ESG credentials.
As extreme heat becomes a global issue, especially in cities, the need for sustainable urban cooling solutions is urgent. Heatwaves harm vulnerable populations and the environment. This shows the importance of nature-based and passive cooling strategies. Initiatives like the Cool Coalition and data-driven heat risk assessments aim to create more resilient and livable urban environments. These efforts focus on fair and sustainable practices to reduce the effects of urban heat, ensuring a better future for all.
Understanding open data initiatives and practices is important. They offer transparency, encourage innovation, and help make informed decisions. Public perception plays a big role in the success of these initiatives. When people see real benefits, like better public services or improved security, they trust open data more. But concerns about privacy and data misuse can hurt acceptance.
For example, the Finnish AI project on feedback analysis has positively influenced public perception by showing clear benefits in service improvement. Similarly, Cleveland&rsquo;s hiring of a new CITO with a strong vision for using technology has gained public support for digital transformation efforts. On the other hand, issues around data privacy, like those seen on social media platforms, show the need for strong governance and transparency to keep public trust.
Today&rsquo;s stories show the power of data and technology in different areas. From improving public services and security to tackling environmental challenges, open data and innovation pave the way for a better future. Stay tuned for more updates and insights in our next edition of the Open Data Digest.
Together, let&rsquo;s use the power of data for a brighter future.
