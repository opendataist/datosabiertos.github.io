  <meta name="title" content="&#34;How Open Data is Transforming Industries: From Internal Audits to Environmental Research&#34;"/>
  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s fast-changing digital world, open data is changing many fields. It helps with new ideas, honesty, and teamwork. Open data is important in areas like internal audits and environmental research. Knowing about open data, its benefits, and its challenges is important for everyone.
In Saudi Arabia, digital change and artificial intelligence (AI) are changing internal audit practices. A study by KPMG shows that businesses must deal with new risks like data privacy and following rules. Internal auditors now work closely with IT and risk management teams. This teamwork helps them work better and give useful insights. Real-time data analysis and AI tools are key for success in this fast-paced world.
Apple and Google have made a tool that lets users easily move photos between Google Photos and iCloud. This tool keeps data safe and transfers metadata, making it easier for users to manage their digital memories.
A Swedish news outlet, Aftonbladet, has started an AI hub that creates article summaries. This has led to high engagement rates. Even though there was some resistance at first, these AI tools have shown their value. Human oversight ensures accuracy. The team has also made other AI tools for journalists, like SEO optimization and proofreading. Aftonbladet&rsquo;s next project, the Election Buddy for EU elections, aims to improve journalistic practices even more. User feedback and management involvement are key to successful AI use and business change.
At the 6th PIAFO event in Lagos, the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC) showed the country&rsquo;s progress towards a safe digital economy. They stressed the importance of data protection and cybersecurity. NDPC highlighted the need for digital literacy, following rules, and strong infrastructure. Leaders like Dr. Ayotunde Coker praised NDPC&rsquo;s work in data protection laws in Africa. Partnerships between the public and private sectors are essential for overcoming challenges and moving forward in the digital economy.
The South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON) has made an Open Data Platform. This platform is a key place for collecting, sharing, and using environmental data. It promotes ethical data sharing and has earned a Trustworthy Data Repository Certification. By encouraging teamwork among researchers, policymakers, and the public, SAEON aims to make a big impact and promote sustainability through partnerships and diverse funding sources.
A recent survey showed mixed feelings about the impact of Consumer Duty rules on customer treatment. Only 22% of consumers noticed an improvement, but younger people had a better experience. Using data solutions is key for companies to meet Consumer Duty rules and improve customer satisfaction. Many see potential for better customer service and more consumer-focused banking as companies adapt to these new rules.
LexPipe, a company that uses AI for litigation pricing analytics, has partnered with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) to make case administration easier for mass filers. By using specialized API services, this partnership aims to improve legal resource efficiency and help law firms handle more cases. LexPipe&rsquo;s expertise in legal data APIs aligns with AAA&rsquo;s goal of enhancing profitability and understanding pricing in the legal industry.
TomTom and East View Geospatial have teamed up to provide global map data to the Australian Government Department of Defence. Using TomTom Orbis Maps, this partnership improves national security and emergency response with accurate geospatial information. This teamwork shows the value of open data in supporting many sectors, giving users reliable location data for different uses.
People should know about open data initiatives because they promote honesty, help with new ideas, and enable informed decisions. Public opinion plays a big role in the success of these initiatives. For example, Aftonbladet&rsquo;s AI hub faced some resistance at first but gained acceptance through user feedback and management involvement. Similarly, the mixed feelings about Consumer Duty rules show the importance of understanding and adapting to public sentiment.
The progress in open data across different industries shows its potential to change things. From improving internal audits and journalism to enhancing environmental research and legal practices, open data initiatives are promoting new ideas, honesty, and teamwork. Embracing open data can lead to a better, more informed world for future generations.
