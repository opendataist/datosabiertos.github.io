Co-founders Magizhan Selvan and Shan MS focus on making products that put people first and improve user experience. Their goal is to become the &ldquo;UPI for mobility,&rdquo; changing the transportation sector.
In an effort to save scientific knowledge, digital data from CERN’s old LEP accelerator is being made available through digital archaeology projects. Teams are updating old software to work with modern tools, making sure valuable scientific data is available for future research. Data from the ALEPH and DELPHI experiments can now be found on the CERN Open Data Portal, allowing researchers, students, and enthusiasts to explore electron-positron annihilation data.
The ELLAS project is working to fix gender gaps in STEM leadership in Latin America by creating an open data platform. This platform collects data from different sources, models it in many languages, and uses knowledge graphs for easy access.
