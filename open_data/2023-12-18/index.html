  <meta name="description" content="Guatemala is having trouble with its national digital ID, says the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The UNDP suggests better data protection, e-commerce support, and improvements in data management and governance. To do this, the UNDP recommends building a strong digital public infrastructure (DPI) and considering gender and people&rsquo;s needs. Guatemala needs to improve connectivity and technical skills. Inclusion and equal access are important for Guatemala&rsquo;s digital changes.
EOMAP, Deltares, and GGS Geo Consultancy are working together to fix the lack of global knowledge and monitoring for coastal areas. They are giving global coastal depth data, which is important for things like danger assessment, seafloor classification, and measuring habitat loss or carbon storage. They use different techniques, like optical depth and wave movement, to get the data from satellites. They are also testing satellite-based monitoring of coastal changes.
Denise Zurilgen and Lauren Costa are back at Ogilvy as global executive creative directors for the IBM account. They will be part of the EightBar team, which focuses on IBM and includes strategy, creative work, media, and data analytics across WPP. Zurilgen and Costa worked on IBM at Ogilvy before and were part of the &ldquo;Made with IBM&rdquo; campaign. They have also worked at Droga5 and other companies. They came back to Ogilvy because of advancements in AI.
Google&rsquo;s AI system, Bard, suggests three cryptocurrencies that could turn $10 into $10,000: Aleph Zero (AZERO-USD), Fetch.ai (FET-USD), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN-USD). It might be hard to make 1,000 times more money in the short term, but these cryptocurrencies have special features and could grow in the future. However, investing in cryptocurrencies is risky, and you could lose money.
The Central Caribbean Marine Institute (CCMI) is halfway through its Expedition Hope project, which studies the plants and animals in two underwater mountains in the Cayman Islands. The UK Government&rsquo;s Darwin Plus Programme is paying for the project. They have already learned a lot about the 12-Mile Bank mountain that was not known before. This information will help protect the mountains and is part of the Cayman Islands Government Biodiversity Action Plan. CCMI made a TV series about the project called Expedition Hope. Next, they will study Pickle Bank, another mountain in the area. The data they collect will help with protecting the environment and making laws. These mountains are important for the future of the Cayman Islands&#39; coral reefs and need to be kept safe.
In conclusion, these news summaries show how important data, information, and knowledge are in many areas. From Guatemala&rsquo;s digital changes to the need for good coastal data, we can&rsquo;t forget how important data and numbers are. Also, the return of creative directors to Ogilvy and the interest in cryptocurrencies show how information is always changing and affecting different industries. Lastly, the Expedition Hope project in the Cayman Islands shows how important data is for protecting our environment.
