    <p> Chattanooga Mayor Weston Wamp expressed concern over the persistent high levels of violent crime and gang membership in the community, particularly among young people. The recent homicide of a 16-year-old Brainerd High School student, who was shot and killed after getting off his bus, has reignited discussions about the effectiveness of current measures to address these issues. The incident occurred in the Eastdale neighborhood, and the Chattanooga Police Department (CPD) is still investigating the perpetrators.  Mayor Tim Kelly emphasized the need to support and engage with young people, especially those who may have made mistakes and are incarcerated or in school. He highlighted the importance of addressing the root causes of gang involvement and crime, as failing to do so will only perpetuate the problem.  According to Chattanooga s open data portal, there have been 18 homicides with one or more victims in 2024, up from 16 at the same time last year. The Eastdale neighborhood, where the recent shooting took place, has seen three murders this year, tying with Alton Park and East Chattanooga for the most murders.  The CPD has urged residents to report any suspicious activity in the area and has created an anonymous portal for people to submit dashcam footage that could help solve the case. The cancellation of the Rhea County-Howard game last Friday was due to safety concerns, but it is unclear if it had any connection to the recent homicide.  Mayor Kelly concluded by stating that the community has failed young people who see no other path to prosperity than through gangs and crime. He called for a collective effort to support and guide these individuals, emphasizing the importance of addressing the underlying issues that lead to such situations.</p>
