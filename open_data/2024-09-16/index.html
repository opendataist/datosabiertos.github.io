  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Daily News Digest! We will look at the latest news in open data, datasets, and how information can change the world. Today, we focus on city planning, new technology, environmental data, and human rights. Our goal is to help make a better world for future generations.
A new study in Nature Cities shows that only a few cities in the world are &ldquo;15-minute cities.&rdquo; This means that most people can walk to essential services in 15 minutes. Cities like Zurich, Milan, Copenhagen, and Dublin are doing well, but big North American cities like San Antonio and Atlanta are not. The study points out big differences in how easy it is to get around in cities. It also shows the health and safety benefits of using cars less. Problems like traffic, crime, and bad weather still make walking hard. The study hopes to inspire better city planning, even though some people resist the idea.
Scientists at Tel Aviv University have created a new touchless infrared imaging technology. It can check pupil size and where someone is looking, even if their eyes are closed. This new tech can track wakefulness, sedation, seizures, nightmares, pain, and response in places like sleep labs, anesthesia, and intensive care. By using short-wave infrared imaging and deep learning, it offers accurate tracking. This breakthrough, supported by the Zimin Foundation and the Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology, could be very useful in both medical and commercial fields, as explained in Communications Medicine.
NOAA and Esri have teamed up to make an open data platform for ocean and coastal data. This project aims to make important environmental data easier to use for decision-makers and communities. By combining NOAA’s large datasets with Esri’s advanced mapping tech, the platform will turn scattered data into easy-to-understand information. This will help with sustainable coastal management and the blue economy. At first, a prototype data hub will show local information for conservation and renewable energy. The partnership aims to help users understand and use data better, with future plans to be decided after a six-month trial.
A recent study by Infyos found serious human rights abuses in the supply chains of companies that make 75% of the world’s batteries. Using an AI platform, Infyos found links to forced labor in lithium refining and child labor in cobalt mining, especially in China’s Xinjiang region. The complex battery supply chains make it hard to spot these risks. But new laws like the EU Battery Regulation and the US Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act aim to fix these issues. Companies that don’t follow these rules could face big fines and investment problems, pushing them to act more ethically.
Another global study ranked Paris and Milan among the best &ldquo;15-minute cities.&rdquo; This idea means residents can reach essential services within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. The study shows the difference in service access between city centers and outskirts. European cities like Paris benefit from old city planning, while car-heavy U.S. cities struggle. The idea became popular during the Covid pandemic but faced criticism from some people. Researchers say that population density and tackling inequality are key to making this city planning model work.
Today&rsquo;s news highlights the importance of open data in solving big problems—from city planning and medical tech to environmental care and human rights. By using data, statistics, and analysis, we can make real changes and create a better world for future generations. Stay informed and involved as we continue to explore how powerful information can be.
Thank you for joining us in today&rsquo;s Daily News Digest. Together, let&rsquo;s build a fairer and more sustainable future.
