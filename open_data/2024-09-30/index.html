  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Daily Open Data Digest. Here, we talk about how open data and technology can change our world. We will look at how they help with social change, the environment, and public safety.
In Zimbabwe, young people are following the example of Kenyan youths. In Kenya, young people used digital media to push for social change. They protested against tax hikes and asked for more government accountability. These protests were powered by online talks among Generation Z. At the Open Data Summit in Harare, Kenyan satirist Justine Wanda spoke about the power of digital platforms. She said they can help amplify the voices of those who are often ignored. Even though Zimbabwe has internet access, the government still tries to silence dissent. Wanda&rsquo;s message to Zimbabwean youths is to use digital media to speak up, start conversations, and demand accountability from their leaders.
In Europe, extreme weather events show the need for better Earth Observation technologies. These tools can help policymakers make better decisions. The Open-Earth-Monitor (OEMC) project is leading the way in creating useful environmental data. From October 2-4, 2024, experts will meet in Laxenburg, Austria, for the second Open-Earth-Monitor Global Workshop. Keynote speakers, like Elizabeth Goldman and Mark Dowell, will talk about improving geospatial research. The event will focus on open-source data and gender equality. The OEMC consortium, which includes 23 organizations, is working with the European Space Agency to make environmental data more accessible.
AI conferences often mix technology and academia, but they can sometimes feel isolated. Raesetje Sefala, a research fellow at The Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR), brings a unique view. She combines data science with social science. Growing up in post-apartheid South Africa, she questioned her government&rsquo;s principles. At the ALL IN conference, she talked about AI projects in Africa and their relevance to Canada. DAIR uses computer vision, satellite imagery, and machine learning to study the effects of spatial apartheid. The BetaKit Podcast, hosted by Douglas Soltys and Rob Kenedi, features these insights and more, showing the link between technology and social justice.
In Rochester, there has been a big drop in shooting incidents with injury. From January to August 2023, shootings went down by 39% compared to the same period in 2022. This matches a statewide decrease of 28%. The Gun Involved Violence Elimination (GIVE) initiative funds strategies to fight gun violence. This has been a key factor in the drop. Rochester reported 111 shooting incidents this year, down from 181 last year. The Rochester Police Department and local officials credit the GIVE initiative and Governor Kathy Hochul&rsquo;s policies for the decline. Monroe County will get over six million dollars in grant funding to keep these efforts going.
Today&rsquo;s stories show the important role of open data, analytics, and digital platforms. They help tackle some of the biggest issues of our time. From empowering youth advocacy and boosting climate action to using AI for social justice and reducing gun violence, accessible data and technology are key. They help create a better world for future generations. Stay tuned for more updates on how open data drives positive change globally.

    <a href="https://datosabiertos.com/open_data/2024-09-30/rochester-reports-a-39-decrease-in-gun-violence-what-we-know/">Rochester reports a 39 % decrease in gun violence : what we know</a>
    <br/> Rochester has experienced a significant 39% decrease in shooting incidents involving injury compared to the same period in 2023. This decline aligns with a broader trend of reduced gun violence over the past three years, following a sharp increase between 2020 and 2021. Governor Kathy Hochul emphasized the effectiveness of their strategies to combat gun violence, while also acknowledging the ongoing need for investment, innovation, and collaboration with law enforcement.  The Gun Involved Violence Elimination (GIVE) initiative, funded by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, supports local law enforcement agencies in implementing evidence-based strategies to address gun violence. These strategies include hot spot policing, focused deterrence, street outreach, and crime prevention through environmental design. Monroe County has received over six million dollars in grant funding from GIVE, with the Rochester Police Department (RPD) allocating half of this amount to continue their efforts in reducing shootings in the city.  In 2022, Rochester was ranked 13th among cities with the highest rate of gun homicides per 100,000 people. The continued decline in annual incidents demonstrates the positive impact of the GIVE initiative in reducing overall gun violence in the city. Rochester Mayor Malik Evans highlighted the importance of various approaches, such as common-sense gun laws, investments in children and families, and advancements in crime-fighting initiatives and technologies, in achieving Governor Hochul s goal of ending violent crime and fostering peace in communities.

    <a href="https://datosabiertos.com/open_data/2024-09-30/what-canada-can-learn-from-ai-use-in-south-africa/">What Canada can learn from AI use in South Africa</a>
    <br/> AI conferences, while primarily tech events, have evolved to include academic elements, creating a somewhat insular atmosphere. Raesetje Sefala, a research fellow at The Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR) and former Mila researcher, brings a unique perspective to these gatherings. With a background in data science and a keen interest in social science, Sefala s work focuses on understanding the human impacts of governmental decisions, particularly in post-apartheid South Africa.  Sefala s approach involves collecting and defining data sets to map and track the evolution of her community. This work is crucial in a democratic country where data should inform government decisions. Sefala s insights were shared during a panel conversation at ALL IN, discussing AI initiatives in Africa and potential lessons for the Canadian ecosystem.  DAIR employs computer vision, satellite imagery, and machine learning to study the impacts of spatial apartheid in South Africa. This research could provide valuable insights for Canada, a country with bureaucratic challenges and a lack of open data and civic tech.  The BetaKit Podcast, presented by Motion, a Canadian company that helps teams generate revenue from paid social ads, delves into Sefala s work and its implications for the Canadian ecosystem. The podcast is hosted by Douglas Soltys and Rob Kenedi, with Jess Schmidt producing and editing the show. The featured image is courtesy of DAIR.  In summary, AI conferences have become academic gatherings, and Raesetje Sefala s work at DAIR highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in a democratic society. Sefala s research on spatial apartheid in South Africa, using computer vision, satellite imagery, and machine learning, offers valuable lessons for Canada s bureaucratic challenges and lack of open data and civic tech. The BetaKit Podcast explores these topics and the potential impact on the Canadian ecosystem.
