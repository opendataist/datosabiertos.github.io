Weekly indicators can show us how the economy is doing before we get monthly or quarterly data. But some indicators, like interest rates and credit, are not good. Housing indicators, like mortgage applications and loans, are also not good. Money and corporate profits are going down. Credit and short indicators are mixed. Indicators like the St. Louis FRED Weekly Economic Index and restaurant bookings are good. Spending and transport indicators are mixed, which might mean the economy is weak.
These things show that open data and being able to see what is happening are important. We need good and true information to make good choices and laws. As women who have raised kids and want a better world for them, we need to know what is happening and ask for open data. If we help with this, we can make a smarter and stronger society.
