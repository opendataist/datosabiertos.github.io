  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s world, knowing about &lsquo;open data&rsquo; is important for making smart decisions and being transparent. Companies that use open data share information so people can see details that affect different issues. By using data, companies can grow, be creative, and have more potential to make money.
Microsoft is successful in cloud services and AI, especially with Azure. Their expansion into new markets, with clients like Moderna and Coca-Cola, shows how data helps with growth and creativity.
The El Niño phenomenon has bad effects on farming in the Philippines. Less sugar and coconut are produced because of the environment. Having correct information helps deal with challenges. People can use data to see how crops and animals are affected, and work on good solutions to make sure there is enough food.
Consumers need to know how companies use data to be clear and real about being sustainable. By knowing how companies use data for their plans, consumers can make good choices and make sure companies are responsible for their actions.
What people think about companies and their open data practices is important. Companies that are honest and open with their data are more likely to be trusted and have loyal customers. But companies that are seen as tricky or not truthful about being sustainable may have problems and hurt their reputation.
The Climate Corporation, a part of Bayer, is a good example of using open data. They help farmers with data on weather, soil, and crops so farmers can make smart choices for sustainable farming.
In conclusion, knowing about open data is important for consumers in today&rsquo;s data-driven world. By understanding how companies use data for their plans, consumers can make good choices and help make a more sustainable and informed society.
