  <meta name="description" content="Finland is leading the way in digital innovation and future skills, with a strong focus on making digital services accessible to all. The Finnish government aims to equip at least 80% of adults with basic digital skills by 2030, recognizing the importance of digitalization in improving everyday life. With a highly educated and digitally literate population, Finland&rsquo;s high degree of digitalization is made possible by a robust digital infrastructure.
One of the key values in Finnish society is transparency, which is reflected in the government&rsquo;s commitment to trust and information security. Collaborating with cybersecurity companies, the government ensures the protection of individuals and companies from digital threats. Furthermore, Finland is open to public-private cooperation, with innovative combinations of public and commercial services driving the digital society forward.
In line with their commitment to transparency, the Finnish government is dedicated to telling the story of their digital footprints across Europe and promoting connectivity worldwide. The city of Helsinki has a data strategy in place to make its data the most usable and most used urban data in the country by 2025. This emphasis on data accessibility and usability highlights Finland&rsquo;s commitment to leveraging information for the benefit of its citizens.
Digital transformation has also had a significant impact on Finland&rsquo;s social security system. Through digitalization, tax administration has become more efficient, resulting in a small tax gap and growing tax revenue. Additionally, the government aims to have all public sector services go digital by 2023, adopting a human-centric approach and comprehensive security model.
While Finland is making great strides in digitalization, it is not the only country harnessing the power of data and information. Alberta, for example, has been using temperature maps to predict the risk of West Nile virus infection. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the reporting of these maps was paused in 2020, and it remains uncertain if they will resume. The Culex mosquitoes that carry the virus have become established in northern parts of the province, surprising researchers who expected this to happen later. Monitoring and treatment for these mosquitoes are limited, and cases of West Nile virus in humans and animals are used to track their expansion.
In the world of technology, Veeva Systems Inc. has caught the attention of investors. Capital Investment Counsel Inc. increased its stake in the company during the second quarter, reflecting confidence in Veeva Systems&#39; potential. Other institutional investors and hedge funds have also shown interest in the company. Research analysts have issued positive ratings and price targets for Veeva Systems, indicating a favorable outlook for the company&rsquo;s stock.
These news summaries highlight the importance of data, information, and knowledge in various aspects of society. From Finland&rsquo;s digitalization efforts to Alberta&rsquo;s use of temperature maps for disease prevention and Veeva Systems&#39; investment potential, data and information play a crucial role in shaping our world. As we move forward, it is essential to prioritize transparency, accessibility, and security in our digital endeavors, ensuring that everyone can benefit from the power of open data.
