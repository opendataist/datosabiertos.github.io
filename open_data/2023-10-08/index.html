  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, we explore the importance of international students in US colleges and universities, the innovative work of Strider Technologies in analyzing open-source data, and the challenges posed by the artificial intelligence revolution.
Dr. Fanta Aw, the CEO of NAFSA: Association of International Educators, highlights the value of recruiting international students for educational institutions. She emphasizes that these students should be seen as true assets to the campus and community, rather than just a means to fill enrollment gaps or generate tuition revenue. While the economic impact of international students is significant, Dr. Aw argues that institutions should prioritize support and programs for their success. It is time to move away from the traditional view of international students as cash cows and focus on the holistic benefits they bring to the educational environment.
In the realm of technology, Strider Technologies, founded by twin brothers Eric and Greg Levesque, along with data guru Mike Brown, is making waves with its cloud-based software platform. This high-tech strategic intelligence firm analyzes massive amounts of open-source data to identify risks and provide a comprehensive view of what&rsquo;s happening. Strider has uncovered instances of intellectual property theft, talent poaching, and supply chain disruption by foreign governments coordinating with commercial actors. With over $57 million in funding and an impressive client base, including Fortune 50 businesses, Strider is at the forefront of leveraging data to mitigate risks and protect valuable assets.
Moving on to the challenges posed by the artificial intelligence revolution, Anita Gurumurthy and Nandini Chami of IT for Change, India, shed light on the potential threats and the need for responsible development. They distinguish between &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; and &ldquo;digital intelligence,&rdquo; with the latter emphasizing the interaction between humans and digital systems. Gurumurthy and Chami raise concerns about the environmental impact, labor exploitation, and concentration of power in large corporations associated with AI. They propose collective licensing, multi-scalar governance models, and justiciable human rights-based AI development legislation as potential solutions. Additionally, they stress the importance of protecting the rights of marginalized communities and promoting digital justice in the face of AI advancements.
These news stories highlight the significance of data, information, and knowledge in various contexts. International student recruitment relies on understanding the benefits they bring to the educational environment beyond financial contributions. Strider Technologies demonstrates the power of analyzing open-source data to identify risks and protect valuable assets. Finally, the challenges posed by the artificial intelligence revolution require careful consideration and proactive measures to ensure a fair and just digital future.
In an era where data, statistics, and records are increasingly accessible, it is crucial to harness this wealth of information for the betterment of society. Transparency and open access to data enable us to make informed decisions, address challenges, and create a more equitable world. As middle-aged women concerned about leaving a better world for our children, it is essential to stay informed about these developments and advocate for responsible and inclusive approaches to data and technology.
