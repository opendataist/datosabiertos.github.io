  <meta name="description" content=" On October 1, Dong Wenhao from Yujing Garden Community in Jinxiang County, Jining City, Shandong Province, reported and installed a charging pile for his new energy vehicle through the  Love Shandong  App, providing only his name, address, telephone number, and ID number. The installation process, which previously required multiple steps and time-consuming visits to various departments, has been streamlined through a joint initiative by State Grid Jining Power Supply Company, Jining Approval Bureau, and Jining Energy Bureau.  The  one-stop  reform simplifies the installation procedures by issuing a  green channel  policy for communities that meet technical standards for electric vehicle charging facilities. Residents can now sign a  Personal Charging Pile Operation Green Channel Community Operation Agreement  with local power supply stations, eliminating the need for property management stamp confirmation.  To further ease the process, State Grid Jining Power Supply Company has collaborated with various departments to open data ports and integrate government service systems with their power supply systems. Residents can now apply for charging pile installation through the  Love Shandong  app or Shandong Government Service Network with a single click, without the need to submit identity proof or real estate ownership certificates.  Additionally, the company has addressed the challenge of charging infrastructure in new residential areas by implementing 48 charging pile supporting power grid projects. Service windows have also been set up in power supply business halls and government service centers for nearby residents.  The simplified charging pile installation process has been recognized as one of the  Top Ten Innovative Typical Cases  in municipal government services, and State Grid Jining Power Supply Company has achieved significant results in benefiting people s livelihoods, expanding consumption, and promoting development. Since the beginning of the year, the company has installed 24,000 charging piles, with sales exceeding 52 million kilowatt hours, ranking third in the province."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://datosabiertos.com/open_data/2024-10-03/state-grid-jining-power-supply-company-charging-station-installation-one-stop-home-service/">
