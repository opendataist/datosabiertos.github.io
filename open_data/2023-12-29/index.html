  <meta name="description" content="Open Data and Earth Observation Partnership Helps Africa
The Research Institute for Innovation and Sustainability (RIIS) has recently joined the GEO Group of Earth Observations Associate, the world&rsquo;s largest earth observation partnership. This is a big deal for RIIS and shows that African private companies are becoming more influential in space. As part of the GEO partnership, RIIS will help Africa improve its earth observation technologies.
The GEO partnership focuses on improving global earth observation systems, sharing open data, and dealing with social and environmental risks. Open data is important because it makes earth observation more transparent and accessible. When researchers and policymakers share data and information, they can learn more about the planet and make better decisions to solve environmental problems.
During GEO Week, the 2023 Cape Town Ministerial Declaration approved the GEO Post-2025 Strategy. This strategy says that open data and collaboration are important for solving global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, and natural disasters. Open data helps governments, organizations, and individuals work together and find new ways to make positive changes.
In other news, Veeva Systems Inc., a technology company that makes software for the life sciences industry, got more investment from Slow Capital Inc. Slow Capital now owns 10,391 shares of Veeva Systems&#39; stock, which is worth $2,114,000. This shows that more people are interested in using data and analytics in the life sciences sector. When companies like Veeva Systems use data and analytics, they can make new things, work better, and help healthcare improve.
The MPF Symposium 2023 talked about the new eMPF Platform and how it can make the retirement system better. This platform helps MPF scheme members and employers manage their MPF more easily. By using digital technology and data, the retirement system can be more clear, easy to use, and work better. The symposium panelists said that protecting data and making customers happy are important in this digital age.
In a different story, the Tamil Nadu Forest Department is investigating a helicopter that flew over protected areas without permission. This is a problem because it puts wildlife in danger and shows that people need to be responsible in fragile places. It also shows that data and information are important for watching and protecting our natural resources.
Finally, in the beauty and skincare world, some people say that the trendy microneedling treatment called Morpheus8 hurts a lot. Even though celebrities like it, it&rsquo;s important to think about personal experiences and pain when choosing skincare. Sharing information and experiences can help people make better choices for their skin.
In conclusion, open data, sharing information, and using analytics are important in many areas, like earth observation and healthcare. When we are open, clear, and work together, we can use data to make good changes, protect the environment, and make smart choices for the future.
