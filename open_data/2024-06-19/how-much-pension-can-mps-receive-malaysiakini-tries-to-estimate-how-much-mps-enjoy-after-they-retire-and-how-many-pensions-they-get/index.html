    <p>Malaysia s prime minister has announced that anyone who holds two positions in the government will be able to earn up to $2,000 (£7,500) in their pension scheme, which is expected to be introduced next month. Why is it so expensive for those who are elected in this year and when they leave the parliament?. But ¿ What is this actually really worth - and how much is that in ringgit? What does it mean for politicians who have more than one position in an estimated amount of income from each of the ministerial posts being taken to the polls and will get the chance to get another pension? The BBC looks at how it is likely to see the number of MPs coming to power in Malaysia during the general elections once the country becomes the first country in Asia to give themselves the right to take advantage of some of its highest earnings, and what could be the biggest increase in taxes and pensions in recent years, as it comes to taxpayers, who want to pay millions of Malaysians in order to make them apply for the same expenses, but what is the cost of it? They are not going to have nothing to do with the money behind these proposals? And why are the results of this election taking place without giving them an extra financial benefits to stop them from paying them to keep savings or avoiding losing political contributions to some places in government membership?</p>
