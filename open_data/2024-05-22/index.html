  <meta name="description" content="In a world where attacks on medics and health facilities are increasing, it is important to be transparent and accountable. A recent report found 2,562 violent incidents in 30 conflicts, with many involving state forces. This shows the need for clear data to hold those responsible and keep healthcare workers safe.
Governments need to take action to stop these attacks, like stopping weapons transfers and enforcing accountability. In Gaza, Israeli forces were involved in 489 violent incidents against medical staff. The lack of information in seven cases shows why transparent investigations and sharing data are important to find out the truth about these attacks.
The Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development is using AI to fight misinformation in Africa. The DUBAWA Audio Platform and Chatbot give reliable information to journalists and the public to combat fake news. These tools show how working together with open data can help people make better choices and hold sources accountable.
In India, the government is promoting AI technology by focusing on open data and ethical AI practices. By investing in telecom, supporting research, and improving education, India wants to be a leader in AI innovation. Initiatives like data trusts, AI CoEs, and ethical frameworks show how AI development can benefit everyone in society.
Open, free, and available data is very important. Whether it&rsquo;s protecting healthcare workers, fighting misinformation, or promoting AI innovation, transparency and collaboration are key for a better and more accountable society. Embracing openness and sharing is crucial for creating a better future for future generations.
