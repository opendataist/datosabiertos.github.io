  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, we have some exciting developments in the world of open data and its impact on various sectors. Let&rsquo;s dive in and explore how organizations and governments are leveraging data to drive positive change.
First up, Veolia and FamousGrey have joined forces to tackle environmental challenges in Belgium. By using real-time data on air quality, water pollution, and soil health, Veolia aims to identify pressing issues and allocate resources for sustainable solutions. This innovative approach demonstrates Veolia&rsquo;s commitment to working in harmony with nature and addressing climate change. By utilizing open source data from government agencies, FamousGrey has visualized the health of Belgium&rsquo;s nature and developed an algorithm to compare variations over the past five years. This partnership is encouraging local action by broadcasting messages linking specific challenges to Veolia&rsquo;s solutions.
In the realm of disaster and climate risk, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) has introduced the Risk Data Library Standard (RDLS). This open data standard aims to make it easier to publish, access, share, and use quality disaster and climate risk data. The RDLS provides guidance on formatting and publishing risk data, benefiting various users such as students, academics, policy analysts, and software developers. The World Bank has already embraced this standard, and efforts are underway to further develop and promote it.
Dell is expanding its enterprise AI models to cater to the growing interest in generative AI. To address concerns around technical complexity, security, and data governance, Dell is introducing the Dell Validated Design for Generative AI: Model Customization. This allows users to deploy generative AI models more quickly. Additionally, Dell is offering professional services such as Data Preparation, Implementation, and Education to support customers in adopting AI technologies. Collaborating with Starburst, Dell is also creating an open, modern data lakehouse to support a broader range of AI workloads and analytics.
Moving on to police policy reforms, Fairfax County in Virginia is proposing changes to address concerns about police shootings and officers chasing individuals. The department is working on developing a formal policy for foot chases, as well as reforming the use of force. While there are differing opinions on these reforms, the establishment of a community equity workgroup and the launch of an open data portal aim to increase transparency and promote dialogue.
In the world of AI, IBM has introduced a new family of foundation models called &ldquo;Granite&rdquo; for its Watson AI platform. These models are designed to meet the demands of enterprise applications and support various business-domain tasks. IBM emphasizes trust and transparency by implementing a comprehensive data governance process and quality checks. The company plans to expand its Granite models, add open-source models, and release new tools to enhance AI workflows.
Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize media technologies, improving content creation, production, and management. However, concerns about trust and authenticity in AI-generated content remain.
The Philadelphia Office of Innovation and Technology (OIT) has developed a Racial Equity Action Plan to prioritize equity in its work. Strategies include developing an equity scoring matrix, enhancing workplace equity, and supporting digital equity. OIT aims to address segregation and improve service delivery for Philadelphia residents.
Anna&rsquo;s Archive has scraped Worldcat, the world&rsquo;s largest library metadata collection, to create a TODO list of books that need to be preserved. They are hosting a data science mini-competition to encourage analysis of the dataset, promoting collaboration and preservation efforts.
Lastly, the British government&rsquo;s decision to reject talks with the EU on a digital partnership raises questions about the future of cross-border digital trade. UK firms have expressed frustration over the cost and complexity of operating under EU laws inherited from Brexit.
These developments highlight the power of open data, transparency, and accessibility in driving positive change across various sectors. By harnessing the potential of data and embracing innovative approaches, organizations and governments can work towards a better future for all.
