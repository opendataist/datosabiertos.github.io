  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Open Data Digest! Here, we share the latest news in open data, AI, and digital change. Today, we&rsquo;ll talk about big steps in AI research, new investments in cloud solutions, and exciting projects in space science.
The Pentagon&rsquo;s Chief Digital and AI Officer has big plans to improve digital and AI tools in the Department of Defense (DoD). One major project is the Advancing AI Multiple Award Contract (AAMAC). This is a $15 billion, 10-year plan to boost the DoD&rsquo;s data and AI skills. The new Open DAGIR framework will help make data and applications work better together. This will help soldiers and make business tasks easier. This plan shows how important it is to work with industry partners to reach these goals.
Avalon Global Asset Management LLC has bought more shares in Veeva Systems Inc. They now own 40,200 shares worth $7,357,000. Veeva Systems makes cloud software for the life sciences industry. This company is 1.7% of Avalon’s total investments. Veeva offers tools for customer relations, content management, and data analysis. The company is worth $34.72 billion and has a PE ratio of 63.37. The stock price is $214.81, with a 12-month range of $162.72 to $236.90. Analysts have mixed views on Veeva, with an average price target of $229.96 and a &ldquo;Moderate Buy&rdquo; rating.
Zacks Research has raised its Q3 2025 earnings estimate for Veeva Systems to $1.05 per share. Analysts also expect Q1 2026 earnings to be $1.06 and Q4 2026 to be $1.19. The consensus rating is still &ldquo;Moderate Buy,&rdquo; with an average target price of $229.96. Large investors own 88.20% of the stock, showing strong trust in the company&rsquo;s future.
The U.S. National Science Foundation and the Simons Foundation are funding two new AI research centers for space science. Each center will get $20 million over five years. The NSF-Simons AI Institute for Cosmic Origins, led by the University of Texas at Austin, and the NSF-Simons AI Institute for the Sky, led by Northwestern University, will improve AI for studying large space datasets. They will also train new researchers and offer outreach activities like summer schools and online courses.
Open data projects are very important for these advancements. By sharing data freely, organizations can innovate, be transparent, and work together better. For example, the OpenStreetMap project lets users add and use geographic data, which helps in disaster response and city planning. The Human Genome Project&rsquo;s open data has sped up medical research and personalized medicine.
People should know about open data projects because they make information accessible to everyone. This helps people and organizations make better choices. Public understanding is key to the success of these projects. When people see the benefits of open data, they are more likely to support and join these efforts.
Take the Flint water crisis, for example. Open data helped reveal the lead contamination in the water. Researchers and journalists used public data to study water quality and bring attention to the problem. This led to government action and policy changes. This shows how public awareness, driven by open data, can lead to big changes.
Another example is open data in environmental conservation. The Global Forest Watch platform gives real-time data on deforestation. This helps activists, policymakers, and researchers monitor and fight illegal logging. Public awareness of environmental issues has grown thanks to this data, leading to stronger conservation efforts.
Today&rsquo;s news shows how AI and digital tools are changing many fields, from defense to life sciences and space research. These advancements promise to improve skills and efficiency and lead to a better, data-driven future. Stay tuned for more updates on how open data continues to shape our world.
Thank you for joining us in today&rsquo;s Daily Open Data Digest. Together, we can use the power of information to create a brighter future for the next generation.
