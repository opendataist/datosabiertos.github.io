  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, researchers at Cornell University have developed an innovative tool called Tree Folio NYC, which creates a detailed digital model of New York City&rsquo;s urban canopy. This model maps every tree and calculates the shading benefits they provide. By considering factors such as street orientation and building height, the tool determines the impact of each tree&rsquo;s shade. The goal of this project is to help cities strategically plant and maintain trees to maximize their climate benefits and ensure equitable distribution.
The Tree Folio NYC model combines lidar sensing and tree census data to create a high-resolution, 3D representation of the city&rsquo;s trees. This information can be scaled and applied to other cities using publicly available data. By understanding the shade provided by each tree, city planners and policymakers can develop strategies to mitigate extreme heat and reduce the heat island effect.
In another exciting development, Synesis One has launched its Train2Earn App &lsquo;Workspace by Synesis&rsquo;. This app allows users worldwide to train artificial intelligence (AI) and earn rewards. The app connects companies in need of high-quality AI training data with digital workers who can generate the data quickly and at competitive prices. This platform aims to create an open data supply chain to power AI applications.
Estonia&rsquo;s digital transformation journey offers valuable insights for governments and businesses. With a focus on digital literacy and innovation culture, Estonia has achieved a remarkable 99% accessibility of public services online. This success can be emulated by promoting continuous digital learning among the workforce and fostering a culture of innovation within businesses. Digital solutions such as workflow automation and HR platforms can streamline processes and reduce bureaucracy. Technology also plays a crucial role in enhancing transparency, improving customer service, and aiding decision-making.
Malaysia Airports Holdings and Asia Mobiliti have partnered with Google Cloud to enhance travel experiences. Malaysia Airports has migrated its digital infrastructure to Google Cloud&rsquo;s open and secure platform, enabling real-time airport and flight information to be provided to passengers. Asia Mobiliti is building its mobility-as-a-service platform on Google Cloud, utilizing advanced analytics and machine learning to offer seamless multimodal transport experiences. Both companies aim to improve connectivity, sustainability, and reduce carbon emissions in the travel industry.
These developments highlight the power of data and information in driving innovation and creating positive change. By harnessing the vast amount of data available, researchers can develop tools like Tree Folio NYC to inform urban planning and climate mitigation strategies. Companies like Synesis One are leveraging open data to power AI applications and create new opportunities for digital workers. Governments and businesses can learn from Estonia&rsquo;s digital transformation journey to improve accessibility, efficiency, and transparency.
In a world where information is readily accessible, it is crucial to utilize data and knowledge to address pressing challenges and create a better future. The advancements in open data and digital technologies provide us with the tools to make informed decisions, drive innovation, and foster positive change. By embracing transparency and accessibility, we can work together to leave a better world for future generations.
