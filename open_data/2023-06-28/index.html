  <meta name="description" content="The world of open data is constantly evolving, with new developments and initiatives being introduced every day. Today, we bring you a roundup of the latest news in the open data space, covering topics such as transparency, accessibility, and the power of data.
In the financial sector, the European Commission has proposed amendments to the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) to bring payments and the wider financial sector into the digital age. These changes aim to combat payment fraud, improve open banking services, and enhance transparency in the retail payments sector. The goal is to create a more secure and efficient payment market that benefits both consumers and non-bank payment service providers.
Meanwhile, Databricks has introduced a new service called LakehouseIQ, which uses generative AI to understand the unique language and data of individual organizations. This knowledge engine allows employees to search, understand, and query data in natural language without requiring programming skills. By making data more accessible and understandable, LakehouseIQ empowers organizations to make informed decisions based on facts and knowledge.
Microsoft has also made significant strides in the AI space, with the introduction of Windows Copilot, a conversational interface that simplifies user interactions with Windows. This development aims to make technology more accessible and user-friendly, allowing users to request specific outputs without complex commands. Additionally, Microsoft unveiled the Copilot stack, a framework for building AI apps, and Microsoft Fabric, a unified analytics platform. These developments highlight the power of analytics and statistics in improving software development and enhancing the employee application experience.
In the transportation sector, various initiatives are underway to improve public access to data and enhance the overall travel experience. NJ Transit has launched a customer awareness campaign called &ldquo;RIDE KIND&rdquo; to promote kindness and respect among customers and employees. SEPTA has launched its Open Data Portal, providing public access to financial, ridership, and mapping data. These initiatives aim to increase transparency and empower the public with information to make informed decisions about their travel options.
On a broader scale, the Internet Society has launched the NetLoss calculator, a tool that measures the economic impact of Internet shutdowns worldwide. This tool aims to demonstrate the negative consequences of Internet shutdowns on a nation&rsquo;s economy, civil society, and Internet infrastructure. By highlighting the economic damage caused by shutdowns, the Internet Society hopes to encourage governments to refrain from implementing such measures and promote transparency and accessibility in the digital realm.
Lastly, a Senate report released on Tuesday highlights the importance of data and information in preventing security threats. The report states that the U.S. government faced an attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021, due to a failure to recognize intelligence warnings about the attack. This incident underscores the need for effective data integration and analysis to identify and address potential threats. The report suggests conducting after-action reviews and increasing interagency coordination to improve security preparations for future events.
In conclusion, the world of open data is constantly evolving, with new developments and initiatives aimed at enhancing transparency, accessibility, and the power of data. From the financial sector to transportation and security, open data plays a crucial role in improving services, empowering individuals, and creating a more informed and connected society. By embracing open data, we can harness the power of information and leave a better world for future generations.
