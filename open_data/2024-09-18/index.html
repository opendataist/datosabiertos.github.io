  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Open Data Digest! In this issue, we look at how open data and AI are changing different areas, from government services to space research. We also talk about big steps forward in digital security and e-governance.
Seven top Indian groups have joined the global AI Alliance, started by IBM and Meta. This alliance includes AI4Bharat, IIT Jodhpur, Infosys, KissanAI, People&#43;AI, Sarvam AI, and Wadhwani AI. They want to promote open innovation and ethical AI development. They will focus on language technology, farming, and responsible AI practices. These groups aim to tackle India&rsquo;s unique challenges and show India&rsquo;s growing role in the global AI scene. They are committed to building a more inclusive and sustainable AI future.
In the United States, two new AI institutes, funded by the National Science Foundation and the Simons Foundation, will create advanced tools to better understand the universe. Each institute will get $20 million over five years to process huge amounts of space data and solve complex space problems. The NSF-Simons AI Institute for Cosmic Origins and the NSF-Simons AI Institute for the Sky aim to make data accessible to everyone. They want to empower researchers and provide AI training and education. These efforts will help make big scientific discoveries and develop the AI workforce in astronomy.
The Department of Defense&rsquo;s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) recently held the Advana Industry Day. This event was to talk about the future of Advana, the DoD&rsquo;s data and analytics environment. The goal was to improve interoperability, increase vendor competition, and bring in top industry solutions. Advana collects data from over 400 DoD systems and is moving to a new contracting model. The event had sessions and networking opportunities to foster collaboration between government and industry, focusing on using AI to tackle current and future threats.
The UNDP is working with the Great Amman Municipality on the &ldquo;Amman is Listening&rdquo; project, a 2021 Global Mayors Challenge winner. This open data platform lets residents give real-time feedback on city services, improving service provision and crisis management. Suppliers interested in joining must submit offers through the system as per the solicitation document. This project shows how open data can empower citizens and improve city management.
Intel 471’s Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) platform has won the 2024 Global Enabling Technology Leadership Award by Frost &amp; Sullivan. The platform boosts organizational security by providing comprehensive threat intelligence and visibility across digital assets. It offers solutions for threat hunting, security operations, and governance, including intelligence on adversaries, malware, credentials, vulnerabilities, marketplaces, and cyber geopolitics. Intel 471’s human-centered approach and skilled analysts give timely, actionable insights, helping organizations proactively secure their environments and reduce risks effectively.
Oman has moved up nine positions to rank 41st in the United Nations E-Government Index 2024, up from 50th in 2022. The country is now the fifth-ranked nation in the Middle East and North Africa and 12th in Asia. Oman improved in the Online Services Index, Telecommunications Infrastructure Index, and Human Capital Index. The country&rsquo;s strong ICT infrastructure and digitized processes, including the 2020 census and electoral process, have helped this progress. GCC countries, including Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait, have also made big steps in digital government transformation.
Open data and AI are driving big advancements in many areas, from improving city services and national defense to changing astronomy and boosting cybersecurity. These developments show the importance of data and analytics and highlight the potential for creating a better, more inclusive world for future generations. Stay tuned for more updates on how open data is shaping our world!
Thank you for reading today&rsquo;s Open Data Digest. We hope you found these updates insightful and inspiring. Let&rsquo;s continue to support and advocate for open data initiatives that pave the way for a brighter future.
