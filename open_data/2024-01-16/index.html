  <meta name="description" content="UK Government Launches Pumpwatch Scheme to Help Drivers Save Money on Fuel
The UK government has a new plan called Pumpwatch to make the fuel industry more fair. Fuel stations will have to show the prices of their fuel within 30 minutes of changing them. This will let drivers compare prices and find cheaper options, which could save them up to 3p per litre.
The Pumpwatch scheme lets drivers see fuel prices on different platforms like mobile apps and websites. This makes it easy for drivers to find the cheapest fuel and decide where to fill up.
People who sell fuel and experts in the industry support the plan. They think it will make prices fairer and create more competition. In Australia, a similar plan helped drivers save about £48 each year.
