  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s fast-changing digital world, it&rsquo;s important to balance new ideas and fair pay for content creators. Justine Roberts, who started Mumsnet, has raised big concerns about Google&rsquo;s plan to change UK copyright law. The changes would let tech giants use publishers&#39; content without paying them. Roberts says this could hurt publishers badly.
Mumsnet is a popular online forum for parents. It has already sued OpenAI for using its content without permission. Roberts admits that Google&rsquo;s indexing helps by bringing traffic to sites. But AI models like ChatGPT use content without giving anything back. This unfairness, she warns, could let big tech companies take over smaller ones, stopping diversity and new ideas in digital publishing.
Roberts&#39; push for fair pay shows a bigger problem with open data and sharing information. As AI gets better, it&rsquo;s more urgent to protect content creators with laws and industry rules. Many people agree that it&rsquo;s important to protect the hard work and ideas of both individuals and organizations.
Globally, the 2024 International Day for Universal Access to Information focuses on &ldquo;Mainstreaming Access to Information and Participation in the Public Sector.&rdquo; This highlights the need for transparency and accountability in government. More people are using the Freedom of Information Act to keep public institutions honest, but there are still problems. In many rural areas, it&rsquo;s hard to find information officers and request forms.
In Zimbabwe, efforts are being made to fix these issues. The Zimbabwe Media Commission (ZMC) and MISA Zimbabwe are working to raise awareness and follow information access laws. They want all citizens, no matter where they live, to have the right to information.
In Africa, using AI faces special challenges, mainly because there isn&rsquo;t enough data. An Open Data Governance approach is needed to make AI more effective and beneficial for the continent. By promoting open datasets and better data management, African countries can use AI to boost development and new ideas.
Understanding these issues is key. By supporting fair pay for content creators and backing efforts for transparency and access to information, we can help create a fairer and more informed society.
