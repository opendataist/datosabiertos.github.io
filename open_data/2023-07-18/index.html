  <meta name="description" content="The Silent Genomes Project, led by the University of British Columbia, is trying to help Indigenous people in Canada with their healthcare. They want to make a bigger database of genetic information that includes more Indigenous people. They have already done a study to find out what genetic conditions Indigenous families might have, and now they want to make a library of genetic information specifically for Indigenous people. They also want to see how precision diagnosis can help Indigenous children and how it affects the economy. A company called Illumina is helping fund this project.
In another news, an article has made a big list of all the states, postal codes, and countries in the world. It includes all 50 states in the United States and parts of Canada. It also has countries from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas like Mexico and other nations in those areas.
Also, WISeKey International Holding and the ONUART Foundation will show the OneHumanityID.CH at the II Global Dialogue event in Geneva. The OneHumanityID.CH is a digital identity platform that uses WISeKey&rsquo;s WISeID technology. It wants to make a global system that puts individuals first and makes the world peaceful through creativity and working together. WISeID lets people do things online safely like email and signing documents. It also has features like extra security and only needing to sign in once. You can go to onehumanityworld.ch to use the platform. WISe.ART is also joining with the ONUART Foundation to make an official NFT marketplace.
These projects and news show how important it is to have open data, be clear and easy to understand, and be available to everyone. By using information and knowledge, researchers and organizations can make healthcare fairer, make big lists of information, and make digital identity platforms that care about people. These things help make a world that includes everyone and is better for our kids.
