    <p>A campaign group has called on the authorities to investigate public funds allocated for public projects in Borno State, which failed to successfully carry out their executions in a bid to stop them from being executed by the country s governing body, the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) investigations.. But How could the Nigerian government take over hundreds of millions of N1.2 billion worth of public money without planning permission and prosecute contractors who disbursed funding for some projects has been calling for further scrutiny and interrogation from the government. Another group says it has found evidence of infractions during the procurement process of some buildings in the north-east of Nigeria, as part of an inquiry into corruption and crimes committed against those who received N21.7 billion in order to protect communities from drug abuse victims, and claims that some of them were illegally awarded to government workers instead of putting the money out of the public, writes the BBC Newsnight. The BBC understands what happened in Nigeria - and how they can be investigated, but calls for an independent watchdog to look at how it handled these cases, with reports that thousands have been discharged from public services in some parts of north and south Nigeria. A petition has heard that more than two million dollars spent on infrastructure projects while tracking and monitoring schemes are not allowed to be released.</p>
