  <meta name="description" content=" This year is critical for democracies globally as they face increasing threats from AI-powered disinformation, such as political deepfakes and manipulated social media content. The European Union (EU) has taken the lead in regulating online content through the Digital Services Act (DSA), positioning itself as the West s digital enforcer. The effectiveness of these regulations will be put to the test during the upcoming European Parliament election in June.  Similarly, the United States and United Kingdom are also preparing for elections amidst concerns about AI-generated disinformation potentially influencing outcomes. The extent of the threat posed by politically motivated AI disinformation remains largely unknown, but 2024 presents a crucial opportunity to assess whether democracies are equipped to handle this challenge.  Several key questions need to be addressed:  1. What role does AI-generated disinformation play in this year s elections worldwide? 2. How are the EU, the U.K., and the U.S. governments managing content moderation and AI? 3. What lessons can be learned from this year s global election cycle? 4. Are the current rules, including Europe s legislation and other countries  commitments, adequate to safeguard the democratic process? 5. What AI-generated content has been created, and did it impact the elections? If not, why not? 6. What is the responsibility of large tech companies in monitoring and controlling AI-generated material on their platforms, and are they doing enough?  A POLITICO event will bring together international policymakers, regulators, and thought leaders to evaluate the significant elections year and discuss how AI can influence democratic processes.
