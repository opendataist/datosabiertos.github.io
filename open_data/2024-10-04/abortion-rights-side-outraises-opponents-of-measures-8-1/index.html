  <meta name="description" content=" The 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade has led to divergent responses from states, with GOP-controlled states implementing bans or restrictions, while Democratic-controlled states have offered some protections for abortion access. These differing state measures, along with significant funding disparities, are expected to influence voter turnout in upcoming elections. Campaigns with more financial resources have a distinct advantage in reaching voters through various channels, including TV, radio, websites, mailers, yard signs, and grassroots efforts. This funding advantage is evident in states like Missouri and Montana, where abortion rights groups have raised substantial amounts, resulting in a significant disparity in ad spending compared to their opponents. In Missouri, over $11 million has been spent on ads supporting a measure to overturn the state s ban, while in Montana, pro-amendment groups have also spent over $11 million, dwarfing the under $50,000 spent by opponents. However, less ad activity has been observed in states like Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Nevada, and South Dakota. In Nebraska, despite abortion opponents raising slightly less money, they have spent more on ad buys. The financial dynamics of these campaigns underscore the potential impact on voter engagement and election outcomes.

    <p> The 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v.

These differing state measures, along with significant funding disparities, are expected to influence voter turnout in upcoming elections. Campaigns with more financial resources have a distinct advantage in reaching voters through various channels, including TV, radio, websites, mailers, yard signs, and grassroots efforts. This funding advantage is evident in states like Missouri and Montana, where abortion rights groups have raised substantial amounts, resulting in a significant disparity in ad spending compared to their opponents.
