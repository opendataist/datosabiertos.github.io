  <meta name="description" content=" Queensland Premier Steven Miles questioned Deputy Premier Deb Frecklington s commitment to reducing crime victims, as he promised to resign before the 2028 election if the number of victims did not decrease during his tenure. Frecklington, who has been referring to youth crime, emphasized the need for fewer victims across the board.  Frecklington also promised a minister for open data to ensure real-time public accountability metrics. However, Miles expressed skepticism about Frecklington s dedication to the pledge, suggesting that Frecklington might find ways to avoid fulfilling his promise after the election campaign.  In the context of domestic violence, Danielle Carroll, Kelly Wilkinson s sister, highlighted the potential benefits of monitoring perpetrators. She shared a harrowing account of how a GPS monitor on Brian Earl Johnston, who murdered Kelly, could have potentially saved her life. Carroll stressed that monitoring offers an additional level of safety for victims of domestic violence, as it could have alerted Kelly to Brian s presence in the bushes near her family home.  Queensland Courts data revealed that there were 27,857 DVO applications in the last financial year, with 4,363 cases so far in 2024-25. The majority of these cases involved men in heterosexual relationships. Additionally, the number of DV-related assaults recorded by police almost tripled year-on-year to 22,293 in 2021-22 after police began recording all offenses associated with DV incidents.  The National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service can be contacted at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732) for support.  In summary, Queensland Premier Steven Miles questioned Deputy Premier Deb Frecklington s commitment to reducing crime victims, while Danielle Carroll emphasized the potential benefits of monitoring perpetrators in cases of domestic violence. The number of DV-related assaults recorded by police has significantly increased, highlighting the need for effective measures to protect victims."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://datosabiertos.com/open_data/2024-10-04/qld-election-2024-lnp-pledge-domestic-violence-gps-monitoring-expansion-trial/">
