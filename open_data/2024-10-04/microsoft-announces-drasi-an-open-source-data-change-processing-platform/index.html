  <meta name="description" content=" Microsoft has introduced Drasi, an open-source Data Change Processing (DCP) platform, designed to automate intelligent reactions in dynamic systems. Drasi aims to streamline data processing by eliminating the need for traditional methods like copying data to centralized data lakes or periodic data source queries. Instead, it monitors for events in logs and change feeds to track data changes.  Drasi s low-code query-based approach enables developers to create complex rules using rich graph queries, written in Cypher Query Language. These queries continuously evaluate incoming changes based on predefined criteria, integrating data from multiple sources without prior collation.  The platform consists of three main components:  1. Sources: These connect to various data sources in systems, continuously monitoring for critical changes. Sources track application logs, database updates, or system metrics, gathering relevant information in real time.  2. Continuous Queries: Drasi uses Continuous Queries to constantly evaluate incoming changes based on predefined criteria. These queries are written in Cypher Query Language and can integrate data from multiple sources without needing prior collation.  3. Reactions: When changes complete a continuous query, Drasi executes registered automated reactions. These reactions can send alerts, update other systems, or perform remediation steps, tailored to the operational needs.  Drasi supports customization and currently supports PostgreSQL, Microsoft Dataverse, and Azure Event Grid Sources and Reactions. Organizations can build their own integrations based on their needs. Drasi is available under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing its use in both commercial and non-commercial projects.  In summary, Drasi is a new open-source DCP platform that automates intelligent reactions in dynamic systems by tracking data changes in real-time. It offers a low-code query-based approach, utilizing Cypher Query Language, and consists of three main components: Sources, Continuous Queries, and Reactions. The platform supports customization and is available under the Apache 2.0 license."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://datosabiertos.com/open_data/2024-10-04/microsoft-announces-drasi-an-open-source-data-change-processing-platform/">
