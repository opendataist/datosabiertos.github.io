  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s fast-changing digital world, being open and easy to access is more important than ever. Governments everywhere are using digital tools to improve public services, as shown in the UN&rsquo;s 2024 e-government survey. This change aims to make services better and easier to reach, especially for people who need them most. But there are still problems, like the digital divide in rural areas, highlighting the need for government support and better technology infrastructure.
Open data projects are leading this digital change. Dr. Aaron Costin at the University of Florida is working on a project to improve transportation systems using open data for Building Information Modeling (BIM). With support from 23 states and international partners, this project aims to make infrastructure better, more efficient, and more sustainable.
Microsoft&rsquo;s new platform, Drasi, shows the power of open data. Drasi is an open-source tool that helps systems respond smartly to changes. It&rsquo;s free to use under the Apache 2.0 license, encouraging new ideas and teamwork.
In research, open-access data has led to big discoveries, like the study on frog teeth evolution by researchers at the Florida Museum of Natural History. Using data from the oVert project, this study shows how important open data is for advancing science.
The work of pioneers like Elizabeth &ldquo;Liz&rdquo; Wing in environmental archaeology shows the lasting impact of open teamwork. Her research helped us understand how humans affect the environment, influencing fields like paleontology and anthropology.
There are challenges on the path to openness. A recent court ruling in Hamburg about AI training datasets and copyright highlights the debate over data use and intellectual property. This case shows the need for clear rules to balance innovation with creators&#39; rights.
Knowing about open data projects and practices is important. They drive technology forward and create a fairer future for everyone. Embracing these ideas helps build a more informed and connected society. Public opinion is key to the success of these projects. When people understand and support open data, it can lead to more trust in institutions and stronger community involvement.
Examples show how opinions affect open data projects. For instance, the UK&rsquo;s open data website, data.gov.uk, faced doubt at first. But as people saw the benefits of accessing government data, public opinion improved, leading to more use and support for open data policies.
Understanding the impact and potential of open data can empower people and communities to push for more transparency and teamwork. By staying informed and involved, people can help create a future where open data projects succeed, benefiting society as a whole.

    <br/> Abortion-rights supporters have raised significantly more funds than their opponents in the nine statewide campaigns to enshrine abortion rights into state constitutions, with nearly $108 million raised compared to $14 million. However, this financial advantage may not guarantee more spending in the final weeks before the November 5 elections. The Fairness Project, a group supporting abortion rights, expressed concern about potential large, late spending on these campaigns.  The fundraising disparity is partly due to the costs associated with getting the abortion questions on the ballots, which required signature drives and legal battles. These expenses often fall on the groups behind the campaigns, reducing the amount of money available for voter outreach.  In Florida, the most expensive campaign, the amendment would make abortions legal until the fetus is viable or necessary to protect the patient s health. Abortion rights groups have raised more than $60 million, while opponents have raised $9 million. However, the state Republican Party has spent $9.6 million on ads urging voters to reject the amendment.  The abortion-rights side has a significant advantage in terms of donors, with more than 94,000 donors compared to fewer than 2,600 for the opposition. Notable donors include Marsha Zlatin Laufer, who has given more than $9 million in Florida, and the Concord Fund and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which have contributed millions in previous years.  Despite the fundraising gap, some big anti-abortion groups have not heavily invested in these campaigns. The Concord Fund and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America have focused on other political priorities, such as helping Republicans win the presidency and Congress.  In Nebraska, where both sides have raised similar amounts of money, the state has competing ballot measures on abortion access. The fundraising disparity in other states may not necessarily translate into a significant advantage in the final weeks of the campaign.  Overall, while the abortion-rights side has raised more money and has more donors, it remains uncertain whether this will result in more spending and ultimately influence the outcome of the elections.

    <br/> Abortion-rights supporters have raised significantly more funds than their opponents in the nine statewide campaigns to amend state constitutions to enshrine abortion rights, with nearly $108 million raised compared to $14 million. However, this financial advantage may not guarantee more spending in the final weeks before the November 5 elections.  In states like Missouri and Montana, the funding disparity has led to more ad spending for pro-amendment groups. In contrast, in Nebraska, opponents have spent slightly more on ads despite raising less money.  Florida s race has unique aspects, such as the need for approval from 60% of voters and the state s current ban on most abortions after six weeks. Abortion rights groups have raised over $60 million, while opponents have raised $9 million. However, the state Republican Party has also contributed to the anti-amendment campaign, spending $9.6 million on ads.  The fundraising gap is partly due to the lack of involvement from two major national organizations, The Concord Fund and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which spent heavily in Ohio last year but have not focused on abortion-related measures this year.  Despite the significant funding advantage, the impact of the money raised on voter outreach and ad spending may not be as straightforward as it seems. The costs of legal challenges and signature drives also need to be considered, as they can reduce the funds available for reaching voters.  In summary, while abortion-rights supporters have raised more money than their opponents in the nine statewide campaigns, the advantage may not necessarily translate into more spending in the final weeks before the elections. Factors such as legal challenges, signature drives, and the involvement of other organizations can also influence the outcome of these campaigns.

    <br/> The 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade has led to divergent responses from states, with GOP-controlled states implementing bans or restrictions, while Democratic-controlled states have offered some protections for abortion access. These differing state measures, along with significant funding disparities, are expected to influence voter turnout in upcoming elections. Campaigns with more financial resources have a distinct advantage in reaching voters through various channels, including TV, radio, websites, mailers, yard signs, and grassroots efforts. This funding advantage is evident in states like Missouri and Montana, where abortion rights groups have raised substantial amounts, resulting in a significant disparity in ad spending compared to their opponents. In Missouri, over $11 million has been spent on ads supporting a measure to overturn the state s ban, while in Montana, pro-amendment groups have also spent over $11 million, dwarfing the under $50,000 spent by opponents. However, less ad activity has been observed in states like Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Nevada, and South Dakota. In Nebraska, despite abortion opponents raising slightly less money, they have spent more on ad buys. The financial dynamics of these campaigns underscore the potential impact on voter engagement and election outcomes. (More abortion rights stories.)

    <br/> This year is critical for democracies globally as they face increasing threats from AI-powered disinformation, such as political deepfakes and manipulated social media content. The European Union (EU) has taken the lead in regulating online content through the Digital Services Act (DSA), positioning itself as the West s digital enforcer. The effectiveness of these regulations will be put to the test during the upcoming European Parliament election in June.  Similarly, the United States and United Kingdom are also preparing for elections amidst concerns about AI-generated disinformation potentially influencing outcomes. The extent of the threat posed by politically motivated AI disinformation remains largely unknown, but 2024 presents a crucial opportunity to assess whether democracies are equipped to handle this challenge.  Several key questions need to be addressed:  1. What role does AI-generated disinformation play in this year s elections worldwide? 2. How are the EU, the U.K., and the U.S. governments managing content moderation and AI? 3. What lessons can be learned from this year s global election cycle? 4. Are the current rules, including Europe s legislation and other countries  commitments, adequate to safeguard the democratic process? 5. What AI-generated content has been created, and did it impact the elections? If not, why not? 6. What is the responsibility of large tech companies in monitoring and controlling AI-generated material on their platforms, and are they doing enough?  A POLITICO event will bring together international policymakers, regulators, and thought leaders to evaluate the significant elections year and discuss how AI can influence democratic processes. The event will also address the role of large tech companies in policing their platforms for AI-generated content and its online amplification.  Participants must acknowledge that their name, biography, voice, remarks, and photographs or videos taken during the event may be used and published in any media related to the event. The recordings may be edited, copied, exhibited, published, or distributed by POLITICO Europe and its Group.  In summary, this year

    <br/> Dr. Ahmed Hashem Abu Nasser, a few doctors in north Gaza, is treating numerous children suffering from malnutrition amidst a severe humanitarian crisis. Israel has imposed restrictions on food, fuel, and water, leading to a man-made famine of unparalleled scale and speed. Consequently, all Palestinians in Gaza are food insecure, with dozens succumbing to dehydration and malnutrition. Despite denials from Israel and the United States, evidence suggests that Israel is obstructing humanitarian aid, potentially constituting a war crime. Investigations, conducted in collaboration with Palestinian reporters and through open-source data, reveal that Israel has been targeting civilians seeking aid and attacking humanitarian networks. These findings are further discussed in the Havana Times.

    <br/> The UN s e-government survey 2024 highlights a global trend towards digital platforms for public service delivery, driven by the need for efficiency and accessibility amidst various global challenges. Vincenzo Aquaro, chief of digital government at the UN s DESA, notes the pressure on governments to digitize services due to crises in food, fuel, health, and sustainable development. The survey shows an acceleration in digital transformation, with AI, cloud computing, and digital ID systems being pivotal.  Top-performing countries excel in online services, transparency, and citizen participation, but challenges persist, particularly the digital divide and inadequate ICT infrastructure in developing nations. E-government is seen as crucial for achieving the SDGs, with technologies like integrated digital ID systems, AI-powered services, data analytics, and IoT improving public safety and waste management.  Open data platforms enhance transparency and trust, while e-government initiatives also combat corruption. Public-private partnerships and ICT investments are key to overcoming hurdles, with strategies including expanding broadband access, promoting digital literacy, and creating data protection frameworks.  The World Bank emphasizes the role of digital public infrastructure in fostering financial inclusion, particularly for marginalized groups. It highlights the importance of electronic signatures in ensuring secure online transactions, calling for policies that balance security and usability to encourage widespread adoption.  In summary, the shift to digital platforms in public service delivery is gaining momentum globally, with significant benefits for efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity. However, challenges like the digital divide and the need for robust digital frameworks remain, requiring concerted efforts from governments, international organizations, and the private sector.

    <br/> Microsoft has introduced Drasi, an open-source Data Change Processing (DCP) platform, designed to automate intelligent reactions in dynamic systems. Drasi aims to streamline data processing by eliminating the need for traditional methods like copying data to centralized data lakes or periodic data source queries. Instead, it monitors for events in logs and change feeds to track data changes.  Drasi s low-code query-based approach enables developers to create complex rules using rich graph queries, written in Cypher Query Language. These queries continuously evaluate incoming changes based on predefined criteria, integrating data from multiple sources without prior collation.  The platform consists of three main components:  1. Sources: These connect to various data sources in systems, continuously monitoring for critical changes. Sources track application logs, database updates, or system metrics, gathering relevant information in real time.  2. Continuous Queries: Drasi uses Continuous Queries to constantly evaluate incoming changes based on predefined criteria. These queries are written in Cypher Query Language and can integrate data from multiple sources without needing prior collation.  3. Reactions: When changes complete a continuous query, Drasi executes registered automated reactions. These reactions can send alerts, update other systems, or perform remediation steps, tailored to the operational needs.  Drasi supports customization and currently supports PostgreSQL, Microsoft Dataverse, and Azure Event Grid Sources and Reactions. Organizations can build their own integrations based on their needs. Drasi is available under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing its use in both commercial and non-commercial projects.  In summary, Drasi is a new open-source DCP platform that automates intelligent reactions in dynamic systems by tracking data changes in real-time. It offers a low-code query-based approach, utilizing Cypher Query Language, and consists of three main components: Sources, Continuous Queries, and Reactions. The platform supports customization and is available under the Apache 2.0 license.

    <br/> Queensland Premier Steven Miles questioned Deputy Premier Deb Frecklington s commitment to reducing crime victims, as he promised to resign before the 2028 election if the number of victims did not decrease during his tenure. Frecklington, who has been referring to youth crime, emphasized the need for fewer victims across the board.  Frecklington also promised a minister for open data to ensure real-time public accountability metrics. However, Miles expressed skepticism about Frecklington s dedication to the pledge, suggesting that Frecklington might find ways to avoid fulfilling his promise after the election campaign.  In the context of domestic violence, Danielle Carroll, Kelly Wilkinson s sister, highlighted the potential benefits of monitoring perpetrators. She shared a harrowing account of how a GPS monitor on Brian Earl Johnston, who murdered Kelly, could have potentially saved her life. Carroll stressed that monitoring offers an additional level of safety for victims of domestic violence, as it could have alerted Kelly to Brian s presence in the bushes near her family home.  Queensland Courts data revealed that there were 27,857 DVO applications in the last financial year, with 4,363 cases so far in 2024-25. The majority of these cases involved men in heterosexual relationships. Additionally, the number of DV-related assaults recorded by police almost tripled year-on-year to 22,293 in 2021-22 after police began recording all offenses associated with DV incidents.  The National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service can be contacted at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732) for support.  In summary, Queensland Premier Steven Miles questioned Deputy Premier Deb Frecklington s commitment to reducing crime victims, while Danielle Carroll emphasized the potential benefits of monitoring perpetrators in cases of domestic violence. The number of DV-related assaults recorded by police has significantly increased, highlighting the need for effective measures to protect victims.

    <br/> Friday s stock market saw a positive response following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, with the U.S. adding 254,000 new jobs in September, surpassing economists  estimates. The unemployment rate also decreased to 4.1%. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, views this as a solid backdrop for stock ownership, as the Federal Reserve has ceased rate hikes and is considering a quarter-percentage point rate cut at its November meeting.  However, single-stock performances varied. Rivian Automotive (RIVN) saw a decline of 3.2% due to lower-than-expected third-quarter deliveries and a reduced full-year production outlook. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose by 3.9% ahead of its anticipated robotaxi event, but Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi Jr. expressed concerns about Tesla s progress in comparison to Waymo and Cruise, which are already operating robotaxis in the U.S.  Spirit Airlines (SAVE) stock dropped by 24.6% after reports suggested the low-cost carrier may file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all saw gains, with the Dow rising 0.8%, the S&amp;P 500 gaining 0.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite increasing by 1.2%.  The economic calendar remains active, with the upcoming release of the September Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the start of the third-quarter earnings season, featuring several major banks.

    <br/> At the Wikimania 2024 conference, researchers Prof. Piotr Konieczny and Dr. Włodzimierz Lewoniewski presented their findings on Americanization across different global regions using open data from Wikipedia and Wikidata. The study revealed varying levels of interest in American topics, correlating with the development stages of countries. This research highlights the significance of Americanization as a subject of scholarly inquiry and showcases the potential of online platforms like Wikipedia and Wikidata for social science research.  The study also draws attention to the uneven distribution of content related to American topics across different language versions of Wikipedia. This discrepancy raises concerns about the global representation of knowledge and the inherent biases present in the platform. The researchers emphasize the need for a more equitable and inclusive approach to content creation and editing on Wikipedia to ensure that the encyclopedia remains a balanced and comprehensive resource for users worldwide.  The presentation and additional materials can be found on the Wikimania website (wikimania2024.lewoniewski.info). Wikimania is an annual conference that brings together volunteers and Free Knowledge leaders from around the world to discuss open-access knowledge projects run by the Wikimedia Foundation. The 2024 edition took place in Katowice, Poland, with over 2,000 participants from 143 countries. The conference website is wikimania.wikimedia.org.  In summary, the research presented at Wikimania 2024 sheds light on the phenomenon of Americanization and its implications for global cultural dominance. The study also highlights the methodological potential of using online platforms like Wikipedia and Wikidata for social science research, while calling for a more inclusive approach to content creation and editing on these platforms.
