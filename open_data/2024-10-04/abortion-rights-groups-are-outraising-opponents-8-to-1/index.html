  <meta name="description" content=" Abortion-rights supporters have raised significantly more funds than their opponents in the nine statewide campaigns to enshrine abortion rights into state constitutions, with nearly $108 million raised compared to $14 million. However, this financial advantage may not guarantee more spending in the final weeks before the November 5 elections. The Fairness Project, a group supporting abortion rights, expressed concern about potential large, late spending on these campaigns.  The fundraising disparity is partly due to the costs associated with getting the abortion questions on the ballots, which required signature drives and legal battles. These expenses often fall on the groups behind the campaigns, reducing the amount of money available for voter outreach.  In Florida, the most expensive campaign, the amendment would make abortions legal until the fetus is viable or necessary to protect the patient s health. Abortion rights groups have raised more than $60 million, while opponents have raised $9 million. However, the state Republican Party has spent $9.6 million on ads urging voters to reject the amendment.  The abortion-rights side has a significant advantage in terms of donors, with more than 94,000 donors compared to fewer than 2,600 for the opposition. Notable donors include Marsha Zlatin Laufer, who has given more than $9 million in Florida, and the Concord Fund and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which have contributed millions in previous years.  Despite the fundraising gap, some big anti-abortion groups have not heavily invested in these campaigns. The Concord Fund and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America have focused on other political priorities, such as helping Republicans win the presidency and Congress.  In Nebraska, where both sides have raised similar amounts of money, the state has competing ballot measures on abortion access. The fundraising disparity in other states may not necessarily translate into a significant advantage in the final weeks of the campaign.  Overall, while the abortion-rights side has raised more money and has more donors, it remains uncertain whether this will result in more spending and ultimately influence the outcome of the elections."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://datosabiertos.com/open_data/2024-10-04/abortion-rights-groups-are-outraising-opponents-8-to-1/">
