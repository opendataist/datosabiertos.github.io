  <meta name="description" content="Open data means sharing and accessing data, information, and knowledge. It helps in different fields for innovation, decision-making, and working together. In the energy transition, strategies like changing stories, community energy planning, and sharing energy data are used to involve communities and let them shape their energy future. These strategies share data with the public so they can take part in the transition.
In artificial intelligence (AI), companies like OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and Meta make big AI models. But now, smaller AI models are becoming popular. For example, Salesforce made coding AI helpers trained on their own programming data. This helps give personalized assistance and interaction with AI for different things during the day. Smaller AI models might compete with big models like GPT-4 from OpenAI.
In earth observation, the Research Institute for Innovation and Sustainability (RIIS) joined the GEO Group of Earth Observations Associate. They want to make Africa better at earth observation and share open data. The GEO partnership wants to improve earth observation worldwide and deal with social and environmental risks. This shows that African companies have more influence in global space.
The CIA is working to rebuild its spying abilities in China. This is because a group of Chinese agents working for the CIA was found out. The CIA is using more resources and hiring people who speak Mandarin to understand China&rsquo;s plans and intentions. This is part of the US getting ready for possible conflicts with China and Russia.
In aviation, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the oneworld Alliance are working together to improve CO2 calculations for airlines. All 13 oneworld airlines are giving operational data to IATA&rsquo;s CO2 Connect emissions calculator. The goal is to give travelers more accurate estimates of their flight&rsquo;s CO2 emissions so they can make better choices. Other industry partners can use the data, and IATA will add new features to make reporting and calculations better.
These examples show how open data is important in different areas. Open data helps with transparency, working together, and progress. But it&rsquo;s important for people to know about these practices and understand what they mean. Open data can be used to control what people think and affect decision-making. So, it&rsquo;s important for people to think carefully about the data they see and be aware of possible biases or tricks. By being informed and careful, people can make better choices and help make a better future.
