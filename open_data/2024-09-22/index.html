  <meta name="description" content="Oman has launched the &ldquo;National Programme for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Advanced Digital Technologies&rdquo; as a key part of Oman Vision 2040. This plan, running from 2024 to 2026, aims to make Oman a leader in AI and boost its digital economy.
A big part of this programme is a national open data platform. This platform will hold many datasets, records, and archives. It will make information available to everyone, including citizens, researchers, and businesses. By sharing data, Oman hopes to encourage new ideas and smart decisions. This can lead to economic growth and a culture of openness.
The programme will also create an AI research center and an AI studio. These places will help develop new AI technologies for different areas. They will have the tools and space needed to create advanced AI solutions, like analytics and language models suited to Oman.
One special project is the creation of an Omani language model. This model will help keep and promote the Arabic language in the digital world. It will support natural language processing and other AI uses, making sure Oman&rsquo;s rich language heritage is part of the digital age.
Additionally, Oman will set up a Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) center. This center will focus on using AI, robotics, and other digital tools in the economy. It will help increase productivity and make Oman more competitive.
The main goal of these projects is to grow the digital economy&rsquo;s share of Oman&rsquo;s GDP from 2% in 2021 to 10% by 2040. This change is not just about numbers; it’s about creating a better future for the next generation. By investing in digital skills and AI, Oman is giving its youth the tools they need to succeed in a fast-changing world.
People should know about these projects because they show a commitment to using data and technology for the common good. Understanding open data and its pros and cons is important for taking part in this digital change.
Public opinion is crucial for the success of open data projects. When people view these efforts positively, they are more likely to support them. For example, Estonia&rsquo;s open data project has strong public support, leading to more transparency and trust in the government. On the other hand, doubt and mistrust can slow down such programs.
In the UK, people were initially skeptical about open data due to privacy and data misuse concerns. But as the government showed the benefits through successful projects like the London Datastore, public trust grew, and the project gained support.
Oman is ready to become a leader in AI and digital technologies, setting an example for others. The National Programme for Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Digital Technologies is more than just a plan; it is a promise of a brighter, more connected future for everyone.
