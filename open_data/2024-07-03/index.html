  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Open Data Digest! Here, we explore the latest news in different fields. We show how important information, knowledge, and transparency are for making a better future.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is getting smarter fast. It sometimes even beats human intelligence. But, this progress brings some problems, especially with data usage. More people are suing AI companies for using their data without permission. Blockchain technology could help by making data use more transparent and fair. Platforms like droppLink are leading the way in ethical AI development. They respect intellectual property rights. The industry needs rules to protect these rights while still encouraging new ideas. Governments and private companies must work together to solve these issues. Balancing legal, tech, and teamwork can protect intellectual property and help AI grow.
In India, the Securities and Exchange Board (SEBI) has made big changes to Futures and Options (F&amp;O) rules. These changes aim to protect investors better. New rules include stricter requirements for stocks, tougher margin rules, and better systems to catch bad practices. The focus is on being clear and teaching investors. These changes hope to make the F&amp;O market stronger and clearer, even if they are hard to put into action. The new rules should help market integrity and investor trust.
ProPublica looked into the New York Police Department (NYPD) and found big problems with transparency and accountability. Missing discipline records in the Officer Profile Database raised concerns. Over 2,000 records were restored after ProPublica&rsquo;s report, but the database is still inconsistent. Some cases involving top officers were missing, showing the need for better data sharing. The NYPD&rsquo;s discipline process is under scrutiny, with reports of possible tampering and hidden cases. Despite some improvements, transparency and accountability issues remain.
The healthcare sector is moving towards e-prescribing. Some US states are thinking about making e-prescribing mandatory for non-controlled prescriptions. This aims to make healthcare delivery smoother and improve patient outcomes. The article also talks about the Finnish healthcare system, the impact of COVID-19 on health IT, and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services&#39; (CMS) move towards value-based payment models. It also discusses the importance of hierarchical condition categories (HCCs) for reimbursement and features insights from a CDC expert on the link between policy and public health.
AI could change agritech in Southeast Asia, making farming more resilient to climate change and improving food security. Agriculture is a big part of the region&rsquo;s GDP and jobs, especially in Myanmar and Cambodia. Climate change brings challenges, but AI can help with better farming practices, livestock management, crop monitoring, and food supply chain efficiency. ASEAN governments are promoting AI in agriculture, but there are obstacles like digital literacy and access to finance. Investment in agritech startups and support for small farmers are key for sustainable growth and food security in the region.
As we deal with modern technology and data usage, transparency and ethical practices are crucial. Whether it&rsquo;s AI, financial rules, law enforcement, healthcare, or agriculture, using data responsibly and protecting intellectual property are key to fostering innovation and building a better world. Stay informed and engaged as we explore the changing world of open data and its impact on our lives.
