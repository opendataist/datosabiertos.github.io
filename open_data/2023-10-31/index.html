  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s fast-paced digital world, data has become the lifeblood of our society. From social media platforms to mobile operators, companies are harnessing the power of data to develop new products and services, improve customer experiences, and drive economic growth. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and the need for transparency and accountability in data collection and usage has never been more important.
One recent case that highlights the significance of transparent data practices is the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission&rsquo;s (ACCC) court battle against Facebook&rsquo;s Meta. The court ruled that Meta&rsquo;s &ldquo;Onavo Protect VPN&rdquo; app misled users by not adequately disclosing how their data would be collected and used. This case serves as a reminder that companies must inform users and give them the opportunity to make informed choices about their data.
Meanwhile, in Azerbaijan, the leading mobile operator Azercell has partnered with Cloudera, a global data processing company, to enhance its data architecture. By implementing Cloudera&rsquo;s Data Platform, Azercell can develop new products and services five times faster than before. This collaboration is driven by the increasing demand for high-speed data and fast broadband as users transition from 3G to 4G networks. The efficient management and processing of data allow Azercell to meet these demands and explore opportunities in the fintech sector.
On a global scale, the Doha Data Forum concluded with the issuance of the Doha Declaration, emphasizing the importance of inclusive data ecosystems and effective decision-making processes. The declaration recognizes data and statistics as strategic assets for evidence-based policies and calls for collaboration between stakeholders to address challenges and seize opportunities.
In India, the Bharti Institute of Public Policy has launched the India Data Portal (IDP) 2.0, providing easy access to information, data, and knowledge for journalists, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. The portal&rsquo;s &ldquo;Visualisations First Approach&rdquo; allows users to access over 3,400 indicators from 120 datasets, promoting a participatory data approach.
Furthermore, Open Access Data Centres (OADC) and TEXAF have signed a joint venture agreement to launch the Democratic Republic of Congo&rsquo;s first open access, carrier-neutral data centre. This facility is expected to have a significant and long-term impact on the country&rsquo;s economy, boosting internet penetration and accelerating digital transformation.
Finally, experts at an international conference in Bangladesh have highlighted the potential of digital public infrastructure (DPI) and artificial intelligence (AI) to eliminate the digital divide. The conference emphasized the importance of accessibility, affordability, and security in promoting digital inclusion and societal advancement.
In conclusion, data is not just a collection of facts and figures; it is the foundation of our digital society. The examples above demonstrate the importance of transparent data practices, efficient data processing, collaboration between stakeholders, and the potential of data to drive economic growth and societal advancement. As we navigate the digital age, it is crucial that we prioritize transparency, accessibility, and responsible data usage to leave a better world for future generations.
