  <meta name="description" content="Open data means sharing data with the public. It lets people, groups, and governments access and use data for different reasons. Companies like Reliance Industries are investing in data centers to support open data and make information more transparent in the digital age.
Reliance Industries, along with Canada&rsquo;s Brookfield and US-based Digital Realty, will open a modern data center in Chennai, India. This is happening as the Indian data center industry grows quickly, with investments expected to reach $5 billion by 2025. The joint venture will start with a 20-megawatt data center in Chennai and plan for a 40-MW data center in Mumbai.
Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, believes Tamil Nadu, where the data centers will be, is a good place for business. He also mentioned Reliance&rsquo;s commitment to renewable energy and green hydrogen, which aligns with their focus on sustainability. This shows how companies like Reliance use open data strategies to grow economically and technologically while being sustainable.
Reliance Industries has also invested in various sectors in Tamil Nadu, including retail stores and Jio&rsquo;s telecom infrastructure. This expansion strengthens their presence in the region and shows their dedication to economic growth and technological advancement.
In Malaysia, public transportation is recovering after a decline during the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of monthly passengers has increased from 14 million in January 2022 to 31 million in November 2022. This is because urban rail services and bus services in the Klang Valley are coming back.
Prasarana Malaysia Bhd, the company that operates trains and buses, reported a 36% increase in ridership from January to November 2022. The Kelana Jaya LRT line and Kajang MRT line had a big increase in riders. To encourage more people to use public transport, they are doing repairs and building new LRT lines. These efforts aim to improve public transportation and make it more convenient for commuters.
These developments in data centers and public transport show how open data helps economic growth and improves people&rsquo;s lives. Companies like Reliance Industries invest in data centers to make valuable data available and promote transparency. The recovery of public transport in Malaysia shows the importance of reliable transportation for connecting people and sustainable urban development.
As consumers, it&rsquo;s important to know about open data and how it affects us. Open data brings transparency and accountability, but it also raises concerns about privacy and data security. By understanding these advancements and their effects, we can make informed choices and support responsible data practices.
