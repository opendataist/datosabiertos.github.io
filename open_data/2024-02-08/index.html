  <meta name="description" content="India is working to catch up with China in terms of research capabilities in the Indian Ocean. The Indian Navy has commissioned a hydrographic survey vessel, INS Sandhayak, to improve its naval mapping and surveillance efforts. China currently has 64 research vessels, while India only has 14. The commissioning of INS Sandhayak is a step towards closing this gap. China&rsquo;s research vessels are equipped with advanced equipment for underwater surveillance and mapping, which is important for military purposes.
Telin, Telecom Egypt, and e&amp; Carrier &amp; Wholesale Services are collaborating on the ICE IV Project, a subsea cable system that will connect the Intra Asia region to India and the Middle East. The project aims to link Indonesia and Singapore to India, Oman, Egypt, and the UAE. It is part of Telin&rsquo;s Indonesian Cable Express (ICE) program. The ICE IV system will provide a new international gateway and an alternate resilient route. It is expected to be ready for service by the fourth quarter of 2027.
A recent panel discussion highlighted the challenges of addressing homelessness through open data. While some forms of homelessness are captured by official statistics, there are others that are not well-documented, such as young people sofa surfing or living in poverty. Lack of access to data, limited resources, and concerns about data protection make it difficult for local authorities to support those experiencing homelessness. The Open Data Institute suggests that collaborating with stakeholders and using open data could help fill the gaps in official statistics and support efforts to address homelessness.
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. The company achieved record revenues and earnings per share growth. Its net revenues for the full year were $8.0 billion, and its operating income reached $3.7 billion. ICE remains focused on innovation and serving its customers in the coming years.
India is aiming to become a leader in sustainable chip manufacturing. Chip fabrication is a complex process that has a large carbon footprint. However, India has advantages such as the Indian Semiconductor Mission, expertise in high technology activities, and a focus on sustainability. By using renewable energy, innovative technologies, responsible supply chains, and greener materials, India can streamline the manufacturing process and reduce emissions. With adaptive ESG policies and collaboration between stakeholders, India can lead the way in sustainable chip manufacturing.
Tech giants like Palantir, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have assisted Ukraine in its defense against Russian cyberattacks. Palantir, known as the &ldquo;AI arms dealer of the 21st century,&rdquo; provides data analytics software and artificial intelligence to support defense efforts. Other tech giants have also embedded themselves in the day-to-day work of the Ukrainian government, providing data analytics for various projects.
Nigeria&rsquo;s National Agricultural Technology and Innovation Policy (NATIP) aims to improve the agricultural sector and enhance food security. However, after two years of formulation, the impact of the policy is yet to be felt. Rising food inflation and increasing food insecurity need to be addressed through the proper implementation of the policy. Legislative responses, multi-stakeholder commitment, improved accountability, and monitoring are necessary for the successful implementation of NATIP. Legislative amendments, particularly to the Land Use Act, are also needed to support the policy&rsquo;s objectives.
The Open Property Data Association (OPDA) has partnered with finova, the UK&rsquo;s largest cloud-based mortgages and savings software provider, to improve access to property data. finova has become an associate member of OPDA and will contribute to the work of the Digital Property Market Steering Group. The partnership aims to improve access to property data and remove barriers to property transactions.
In conclusion, recent developments highlight the importance of data, information, and transparency in various sectors. Open data and collaboration play a crucial role in driving progress and creating a more accessible and knowledgeable world.
