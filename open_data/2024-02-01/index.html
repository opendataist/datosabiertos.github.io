  <meta name="description" content="Open data is important because it gives people information that is easy to understand and access. It helps them make good choices and understand what is happening in their communities. In this article, we will talk about some recent improvements in open data that are helping us learn more about different things.
One improvement is in transportation data. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) has made their data portal better. Now, people can see more information about how many people ride the trains and buses. They can also see data about how the authority is stopping people from not paying for their fares. This upgrade helps people see how they travel and makes transportation services better.
Another example is the PATH commuter rail system in New York and New Jersey. It has been growing and served 50.5 million passengers in 2023. This shows that public transportation is important. It also shows that having accurate and up-to-date data helps with planning and making good choices.
In Kansas, the Department of Revenue has made an app called Assessment Connect. This app helps people who appraise property. It makes the process easier and more transparent. The app also has a place where people can see the value of different properties in Kansas. This helps people know more about property values and makes the real estate market fair.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, data is very important for public health. In Ottawa, the number of COVID-19 cases is going down, but the number of flu cases is still high. This information helps health authorities make good choices about safety measures.
In San Diego, the Metropolitan Transportation System (MTS) is making transit safer. They are hiring more security officers and making sure they can respond quickly. They use data to see where there are problems and put resources where they are needed.
Open data is making our communities better. It helps us understand different things in our lives. It is important for people to know about open data and support it. It helps us make good choices and makes the future better for everyone.
